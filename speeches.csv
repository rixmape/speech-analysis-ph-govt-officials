VPSD Speech on Go Negosyo's 18th anniversary,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-go-negosyos-18th-anniversary,2023-11-27,"Assalamualaikum… Madayaw ug maayong gabii kaninyong tanan. Magandang gabi sa inyong lahat. Tonight, we celebrate the power of entrepreneurship to transform lives and build dreams. I congratulate Go Negosyo on its 18th anniversary and express my most profound admiration for the visionary leadership of Mr. Jo Concepcion, whose innovative mindset has influenced and inspired a culture of entrepreneurship among many Filipinos. For 18 years, Go Negosyo has been empowering aspiring Filipino entrepreneurs with the tools and resources they need to succeed. This has led to the growth of a supportive community that enables entrepreneurship to thrive. To achieve a truly progressive nation, we must start by instilling an innovative mindset in the Filipino youth. This is why the Department of Education has signed an agreement with Go Negosyo to introduce entrepreneurship to high school students. Through the MATATAG Agenda, we are investing in a future where Filipinos can readily identify opportunities for creating wealth and are equipped to respond to social and economic changes with agility and confidence. Let me share some salient points from the Memorandum of Agreement we forged today. Pampaaralang Taniman ng mga Agribida Our response to the national policy of building agriculture as one of the stronges backbones of wealth creation is ""Pampaaralang Taniman ng mga Agribida."" We want to inspire a new generation of agricultural leaders through this program. We will introduce basic agricultural concepts to high school students, establish school-based gardens, and cultivate cash crops using school sites. School gardens are more than just a place to grow food. They provide a platform for communities to come together, work towards a shared goal, and promote healthy eating habits. Go Negosyo will inspire innovative marketing strategies to generate sustainable revenue projects for local farmers and student entrepreneurs with the help of private sector funding and Parents' Teacher Associations or PTAs. We can build a thriving and equitable food system for our communities by empowering students and farmers through entrepreneurship and promoting sustainable agriculture. We will also work on Agribusiness Education Mentoring Entrepreneurs through our teachers Youthpreneur Mentorship Program Enterprise development is a powerful catalyst for wealth creation. Partnering with Go Negosyo, a leader in MSME empowerment, will help the educational sector craft responsive curricula, programs, and activities to build a strong economy for the future. We are excited about our partnership, we are excited forthe children. It will develop a responsive curriculum for agribusiness and entrepreneurship. By incorporating real-world examples and hands-on activities, we will help learners grasp theoretical concepts and foster an entrepreneurial spirit. Let us make entrepreneurship a driving force for progress and social mobility. Together, let us transform lives and build dreams. Patuloy tayong maging MATATAG sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at mga Batang Makabansa. Lahat – para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipno. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for National Children's Month Culminating Activity,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-national-childrens-month-culminating-activity,2023-11-27,"November 27, 2023, at 2:00 PM Ladies and gentlemen… Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. Today, we conclude the observation of National Children’s Month, reminding us that we are tasked to provide our children with a safe, nurturing, and loving life that allows them to play, learn, and grow into responsible, productive, and well-rounded individuals. This task is binding and requires our will, commitment, and a strong sense unity of purpose as a community of elected leaders, policymakers, educators, advocates, development partners, business sector supporters, and parents — all working together to champion Filipino children. As a community, we are dedicated to upholding a child’s right to survival, protection, development, and participation. We cannot fail our children. We must not fail our children. But we will only be truly successful in this cause if we acknowledge the situation of children in the Philippines. This is important because this is where we should come together as a community — to present policies, interventions, and programs for the development, growth, and protection of Filipino children. In the Philippines, we should acknowledge that a child's voice almost always disappears in the noise — practically depriving their sector of the right to be counted or to participate in matters affecting their future. We should also acknowledge that despite our efforts and the number of interventions and resources for child protection, many Filipino children are still living in conditions of violence, poverty, and inadequate access to education, healthcare, shelter, and other basic services. DEPED EFFORTS As a community, we have the power to change this. For the Department of Education — we opened the observation of National Children’s Month with an online program to emphasize the urgency of the need to address child abuse online. A United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund report has once said that the Philippines “has become the global epicenter of the live-stream sexual abuse trade, and many of the victims are children.” The magnitude of this problem is doubly unsettling because our children have access to the internet, where information exchange is fast and even real-time. Apart from sexual abuse and exploitation, our children may also become the victim or the perpetrator of online bullying, hate speech, and other forms of abuse. DepEd’s Learner Rights and Protection Office, or LRPO, spearheaded the online program with a sub-theme, “Stay Curious, Stay Cautious: Empowering Learners to Surf Safely.” The objective was to underscore our commitment to fostering curiosity and emphasize our country’s dedication to shielding children from online violence and abuses. We have also undertaken several steps to address the presence of threats to the physical and psychological security of Filipino children. Last year, DepEd established the Telesafe Contact Center Helpline to receive and process reports of abuses committed against our learners. This is part of the Learner Rights and Protection Office. The primary objective of this Helpline is to offer immediate assistance, intervention, and referral to any reported incidents of learner rights and protection violations. As of November 27, 2023, our Helpline has received a total number of 1709 reports, with verbal abuse committed against our learners ranking as the highest, followed by sexual abuse and cyberbullying. In time for the observation of National Children’s Month, the LRPO will also be implementing the following policies, with emphasis on DepEd’s advocacy of protecting our learners and strengthening our educators’ passion for upholding our learners’ rights: DepEd Learner Rights and Protection Policy. This is the enhancement of DepEd Order No. 40 or the “DepEd Child Protection Policy. This will include recently enacted laws and other issuances in line with protecting our learners and our educators. Guidelines on Implementing the Safe Spaces Act in Basic Education Institutions. This new policy is being introduced in line with Republic Act 11313, or the “Safe Spaces Act,” which expanded the definition of sexual harassment. The policy aims to address gender-based sexual harassment in schools, ensuring a safe and positive learning environment free from gender-based violence, especially gender-based sexual harassment that may be committed to our learners, educators, and personnel. Protocol on Handling Children in Situations of Armed Conflict or C-S-A-C Learners in the Department of Education. Due to the alarming incidence of armed conflicts that directly affect schools and students, DepEd is issuing a policy that mandates all DepEd personnel and stakeholders to strictly adhere to the appropriate handling and treatment of CSAC learners. We must prioritize the protection of these learners during times of conflict. These policies are our commitment to creating an environment for Filipino learners to thrive and live dignified lives. These policies are not merely directives but imperatives for teachers, DepEd personnel, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, partners, and stakeholders. Teachers play a pivotal role in translating these policies into daily practice by ensuring the well-being of our learners. Simultaneously, DepEd personnel must internalize and uphold these standards, fostering a culture where child protection and ethical practices become intrinsic to delivering quality basic education to Filipino children. These policies extend beyond our classrooms, necessitating integration into the community—where we expect the support of our partners and education stakeholders. PARTNERS Speaking of partners… Thank you to our partner organizations and agencies… the Consuelo Zobel Alger Foundation, Geneva Human Rights Education, UNICEF Philippines, Stairway Foundation Inc., and many others… We look forward to expanding and strengthening valuable partnerships for the future of Filipino learners with you. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our partnership with the Philippine National Police to ensure that our schools and learners are protected from criminality and illegal drugs. The Armed Forces of the Philippines has also been very helpful in our campaign to protect our learners from the recruitment of violent extremism and insurgency. CONCLUSION Building a culture of safety and an environment that protects our children from harm is a community effort. It is a by-product of various initiatives, practices, or interventions that put child protection at the center. The task of the Education sector is not only to ensure that learners get the best basic education available for them — but more importantly, we have the task to ensure that we provide them with a safe, nurturing, and loving space that allows them to play, learn, and grow responsible, productive, and well-rounded individuals. We all can make a difference for the Filipino children. Mga kababayan, patuloy po tayong maging MATATAG tungo sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Ang lahat po ng ating ginagawa ay para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."

Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan.Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. I never knew Senator Miriam when she was alive. I only knew her from stories of Sir Jun. Sir Jun invited me to the first death anniversary of Sen Miriam. That was how we became friends with Sir Jun. Thank u Sir for inviting me to join you in renaming the street marker for Sen Miriam. Today, we are gathered here to honor and pay tribute to one of our country's most distinguished and admired national leaders, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago. Seeing Agham Road and BIR Road, renamed Senator Miriam P. Defensor-Santiago Avenue, is truly heartwarming. This is a tribute to her incredible achievements and a reminder of her unwavering dedication and love of country. Senator Miriam P. Defensor-Santiago was a true inspiration, and her legacy will continue to inspire future generations. Her life story is a testament to the Filipino youth that anything is possible if we put our heart and soul into it. She came from humble beginnings in Iloilo and went on to become the first Filipino and a woman at that Asian elected to the International Criminal Court. She was the first Filipino commissioner for the International Development Organization and received the Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 1988. Her achievements are a testament to the power of hard work and perseverance in adversity. As we stroll along this newly dedicated road, let us all take a moment to remember Senator Miriam's bravery and conviction. She fought tirelessly to improve the lives of our fellow Filipinos, and her legacy will continue to inspire us to do the same. May this road serve as an expression of our gratitude for a remarkable and unforgettable and colorful Filipina who fought for truth and upheld legal brilliance while fighting against corruption in the government. She embodied integrity in a society that often lacked it, especially in our pursuit for genuine public service. May this road serve as a reminder of her lasting legacy and motivate us to follow in her footsteps. Let us show gratitude for her remarkable contributions to our country with a deep sense of nationalism that she passionately instilled in the hearts of many Filipinos esp the youth. Her spirit will continue to guide and inspire us in our quest to build a better and brighter future for our country.

VPSD Speech During the Signing Ceremony for the Records of Discussion of the JICA-assisted Formulation of the Comprehensive and Sustainable Urban Development Masterplan for Metropolitan Davao,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-during-signing-ceremony-records-discussion-jica-assisted-formulation-comprehensive-and-sustainable-urban-development-masterplan-metropolitan-davao,2023-11-16,"REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Davao City Today marks the beginning of a grand vision for a sustainable metropolis within the Davao Region. The signing of the Record of Discussions for the Comprehensive and Sustainable Urban Development Master Plan for Metropolitan Davao is a significant milestone, marking the official start of the Philippine-Japan Technical Cooperation Project. Over the years, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA, has been an invaluable development partner in the Davao Region, providing technical assistance and financial support for various projects. Their continued support will enable us to create a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to development planning, leading to higher economic output and the integration of fiscal and non-fiscal plans. The master plan covers various critical aspects, including developing agricultural and commercial industries, climate resilience, ecological balance, and integrity. It will assist us in planning for educational growth and development, physical and technological connectivity, human and transportation mobility, and the enhancement of integrated health and social services. As we expand master planning across the influence areas of Metropolitan Davao, we facilitate more balanced urban planning and development. This also supports the national spatial strategy by facilitating regional agglomeration to encourage the growth of sub-regional centers and help pull developments into adjacent physical areas. We see this cooperation as strategic, being a gateway to the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. We can empower more local economies in the Davao Region to be competitive and independently initiate economic and multi-disciplinary approaches with our BIMP-EAGA and ASEAN neighbors. The Record of Discussions signed today solidifies our vision anchored on RA 11708, or the Metropolitan Davao Development Authority Act. This document will help us track our progress, identify and address emerging challenges, balance resources and opportunities, and recalibrate our approaches relevant to the rapidly changing global landscape. I recognize the full support and backing of the National Economic Development Authority. Your role is crucial in crafting the regional development plans, strategically identifying the region’s needs, and linking local government projects to funding agencies and other government partners. Let me laud the efforts of the Regional Development Council XI for carrying the torch and continuing the vision we have started. We are one step closer to our dream of a vibrant, livable, resilient, and sustainable Metropolitan Davao. Let us all work towards a shared sense of responsibility and accountability as we generate commitments across different sectors and jurisdictions. It is essential to implement the master plan successfully and to achieve our shared regional aspirations. I am confident that implementing the Metropolitan Davao Master Plan will significantly contribute to achieving the overall development plan outlined in the Philippine Vision 2040. Above all, this plan is not just for us but for future generations. It will allow our children to enjoy the fruits of our hard work and benefit from the competitive advantage of expanding and building on diversified strengths. Let us work together to create a sustainable and prosperous future for all. In closing, I would like to thank the Government of Japan. Thank you so much, Ambassador, for always holding the hand of Davao City throughout the years. And now, holding the hand of Davao Region. Thank you very much. Maging MATATAG tayo sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at mga Batang Makabansa. Lahat – para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for 18th PSECE,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-18th-psece,2023-10-31,"18TH PHILIPPINE SEMICONDUCTOR & ELECTRONICS CONVENTION AND EXHIBITION (PSECE) Day 1 Plenary Session World Trade Center, Pasay City Today, it is evident that the Philippines has earned recognition as a significant contributor to the global semiconductor and electronics supply chain. Our country has emerged as a pivotal manufacturing and assembly hub, playing a crucial role in the production of diverse electronic components, ranging from integrated circuits to sensors and microprocessors. The semiconductor and electronics industry in our country has made numerous significant contributions that deserve acknowledgment. First, it has been a major contributor to our economy, generating substantial export revenues and creating job opportunities for Filipinos inside the country. This industry consistently ranks among the top export sectors in the Philippines, contributing to the improvement of our country's balance of trade and attracting foreign direct investments. Notably, the industry has also played a crucial role in job creation. It has provided employment opportunities across various skill levels, from assembly line workers to engineers and technicians. This has resulted in the reduction of unemployment rates and the improvement of the standard of living of Filipinos. It cannot be denied that the industry has been at the forefront of technological advancements in our country. The presence of multinational companies in this sector has facilitated the transfer of technology and knowledge, enabling local workers to acquire new skills and expertise. As a result, we have developed a skilled workforce capable of handling complex manufacturing processes. Moreover, your industry has stimulated the development of a robust supply chain ecosystem. Local suppliers and service providers have emerged to support the industry's needs, creating a multiplier effect on the economy. This has led to the establishment of specialized manufacturing zones and industrial parks that further enhance the business climate in our country. Last but certainly not least, the industry has contributed significantly to research and development activities. Collaborations between universities, research institutions, and semiconductor companies have resulted in the development of innovative technologies and solutions. This not only enhances the competitiveness of the industry but also stimulates innovation in other sectors, leading to further economic growth and progress. Despite the aforementioned factors, however, there is still potential for growth within the industry. It is within this realm that I firmly believe education plays a vital role. First, educational institutions can enhance their curriculum by collaborating with industry experts and stakeholders to ensure that it is always a step ahead of the evolving needs of the industry. By incorporating emerging technologies, industry-specific skills, and practical training opportunities, education can equip students with the relevant knowledge and skills needed to excel in the field by the time they graduate. Second, industry-academia collaboration is essential. Establishing strong partnerships between educational institutions and the semiconductor and electronics industry can lead to resource sharing, joint research projects, internships, and industry-led workshops. These collaborations bridge the gap between academia and industry, ensuring that education remains industry-relevant and students gain practical exposure and experience. Third, education can promote entrepreneurship in the industry by offering courses and programs that nurture business skills and encourage innovation. Providing mentorship, access to incubators, and networking opportunities can empower aspiring entrepreneurs to establish their own ventures, contributing to the industry's growth. Finally, education should emphasize the importance of research and development (R&D). By investing in R&D and facilitating collaborative research projects between academia and industry, educational institutions can contribute to advancing technology, improving product quality, and developing new solutions. Additionally, education should encourage a culture of continuous learning and professional development among students and industry professionals, ensuring that they stay updated and continuously upskill to contribute to the industry's growth. As we move forward, it is essential for industry leaders to actively participate in shaping the future of education and workforce development. Therefore, I strongly urge you to actively engage in the current review of the curriculum for grades 11 and 12, as it presents a valuable opportunity to shape the education of our learners in preparation for the future of the semiconductor industry. By participating in this process, you can contribute to ensuring that the curriculum aligns with the needs and demands of the industry. This will enable our learners to acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, and competencies to excel in the semiconductor sector, fostering their personal growth and preparing them to be valuable assets in the workforce. Mga kababayan, patuloy tayo maging MATATAG sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at mga Batang Makabansa. Ang lahat para sa Diyos, Bayan, at Pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for the 49th Philippine Business Conference and Expo,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-49th-philippine-business-conference-and-expo,2023-10-26,"PHILIPPINE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY (PCCI) 49th Philippine Business Conference and Expo (PBC & E) The Manila Hotel, Ermita, Manila Education has always been a catalyst for sustained economic growth. In an increasingly interconnected global landscape, the quality of education provided to the Filipino youth plays a crucial role in shaping both their individual futures and the progress we make as a society. In striving for a first world economy, we need to invest in upgrading education towards first world standards. Quality education is the foundation for the development of human capital – our country’s greatest resource. So with the vision of producing Filipinos who are resilient, globally competitive and contributors to nation-building, the Department of Education launched the MATATAG Agenda called Basic Education Development. MATATAG stands for: MA – Make the curriculum relevant to produce job-ready, active, and responsible citizens. TA - Take steps to accelerate the delivery of basic education services and provision of facilities. TA – Take good care of learners by promoting learner well-being, inclusive education, and a positive learning environment. G - Give support for teachers to teach better. Covering core areas such as the curriculum, infrastructure, learning resources, and teacher welfare, this serves as our roadmap in upgrading the quality of basic education towards First World standards. Guided by the MATATAG Agenda, we have taken initiatives to address the various challenges confronting basic education today. For our gathering this afternoon, I will be providing four — one is the Curriculum, Teacher Welfare, Infrastructure, and Technology. Curriculum At the heart of any education system is its curriculum. Recognizing the importance of adapting our basic education system to the needs of the 21st century, we launched the MATATAG K-10 Curriculum last August 2023. Placing emphasis on holistic development, the MATATAG Curriculum encompasses critical life skills, values education, and learner support. This decongested, streamlined and recalibrated curriculum is now being piloted in 35 schools, located in 7 regions across the country. We expect to gain valuable lessons from these pilot schools who will also undergo assessments during the pilot, to prepare us for the nationwide phased-implementation come school year 2024-2025. Simultaneous to this pilot is the ongoing review and revision of the Senior High School curriculum, the Grades 11 and 12. I would like to take this opportunity to invite the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and all its members to participate in the review, and provide valuable insights on skills-matching in order to boost employability for our graduates. We need all the help we can get from the experts. From you. Technology Today's learners grow up in a digital era, and it is critical that we adapt our teaching methodologies to engage and prepare them for the future. The adoption of digital literacy, e-learning platforms, and interactive classroom environments must be integrated into the educational process. To this end, we are unveiling the DepEd Digital Education 2028 or DepEd Digi-Ed. The backbone of technology lies in connectivity. We are aggressively taking steps to provide School-Wide Wi-Fi across the country. We have been negotiating with the likes of Starlink, PLDT, Converge, Globe and other service providers to make this a reality. 25 schools have initially been chosen for Starlink’s proof of concept, while 2,000 other schools are currently being given satellites for internet connectivity. Imagine multiple libraries in the palm of your hand. In the palm of our students in public schools. Digitization of learning resources is at the top of our agenda. We are looking to procure digital textbooks, as well as supplementary learning resources that will be made available to learners and teachers, be it online or offline. We have been holding regular discussions with publishers, both big and small, to procure digital resources as early as 2024. To complement these digital resources, we are currently developing the MATATAG Portal. This will serve as a platform for learners to have instant access to their lessons, resources, modules, activity sheets and assessments with a unique log-in key. Further, we are currently procuring Digi-Ed Learning Carts. These computer-labs-on-wheels, are each composed of 46 laptops, hard drives, a charging cart and a smart TV. We are on track to provide our schools with E-Learning carts in the coming months. In embracing technology, we envision an environment of borderless classrooms and learning without disruptions. Infrastructure Even with advances in technology, however, we must still acknowledge the pivotal role that sufficient and resilient school infrastructure plays in fostering a conducive learning environment. We have created a strand under the Department of Education dedicated for the School Infrastructure and Facilities (SIF). This strand is dedicated to accelerating the delivery of school buildings and other basic educations facilities. We will continue to build more classrooms. So far, the construction of 2,201 new classrooms have now been completed. We have also recently held the simultaneous inauguration of 15 last mile schools, with 45 more last mile sites scheduled to be turned over within the year. In view of the usual fiscal restrictions of the national budget, funding from the private sector plays a vital role. At present, the Department is looking at obtaining financing from the World Bank through the Infrastructure for Safer and Resilient Schools project. This facility will address the repair and rehabilitation of disaster-affected schools. We are also exploring partnerships with other government agencies such as PAGCOR and the private sector to supplement our School Buildings Program. More importantly, we remain committed to transparency and accountability. As such, we are currently procuring a developer for the School Infrastructure Transparency Website. This will provide instant access for the general public to see real-time progress on schools and classrooms being built nationwide. Teacher Quality Finally, we firmly believe that teachers are the cornerstone of effective education. Aside from exploring additional benefits and strengthening our professional development programs, we want our teachers to do what they do best — go back to the classrooms and teach. We will bring our teachers back to the classrooms by removing the various administrative tasks that they are burdened with. Currently, we are tracking interim guidelines to reduce the 50 administrative tasks to 10 — those with legal basis only. Ladies and Gentlemen, we may have lofty goals, but they are not unattainable. Upgrading the basic education system to meet 1st World standards is not a mere aspiration – it is imperative if we are to create a future where every child has the opportunity to succeed. While we have taken significant strides, there is so much left to do. And as we have always maintained, DepEd cannot do this alone. The improvement of Basic Education is a continuous journey that requires a whole-of-nation approach. It involves an unwavering collaboration and commitment from all stakeholders – including the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Together, we will produce future leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators that are capable of meeting the demands of the fast-changing job market. Together, we will work to improve the Philippine educational landscape, one learner at a time. Mga kabababayan, patuloy tayong maging MATATAG tungo sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Lahat para sa Diyos, Bayan at Pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."

VPSD Speech for the 2023 National Literacy Conference,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-2023-national-literacy-conference,2023-10-13,"INTERCONNECTED FOUNDATIONS: EXPLORING THE LINK BETWEEN LITERACY, PEACE, SECURITY, AND COUNTRY STABILITY 2023 National Literacy Conference Cebu City Mga kababayan, ladies and gentlemen, Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. Today, I would like to emphasize the crucial role of literacy in unlocking opportunities, empowering individuals, and driving our nation forward. The Department of Education stands at the forefront, paving the way for literacy development in our country through various programs and initiatives. Our goal is to promote functional literacy and ensure that every Filipino possesses the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today's complex world. Functional literacy goes beyond simply reading and writing. It encompasses the skills necessary to apply this knowledge in real-life situations. It equips individuals with the ability to make informed decisions, communicate effectively, and actively participate in the workforce and society. To enhance functional literacy across all levels of education, the Department of Education has taken significant steps. Let me highlight some of the key initiatives undertaken by DepEd: First, the implementation of the K to 12 Program. This is one of the most notable reforms in our educational system. It provides a holistic and well-rounded education and emphasizes functional literacy through the incorporation of practical life skills, work education, and entrepreneurship in the curriculum. The recent revision of the K to 10 curriculum under the MATATAG Curriculum ensures the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, good manners, right conduct, peace education, and other essential skills. This revision acknowledges the evolving demands of the 21st century, where learners must analyze complex issues and adapt to rapidly changing environments. Second, we have the Alternative Learning Systems (ALS) program, which offers education to out-of-school youth and adults. ALS has significantly expanded access to education for those who may have missed formal schooling, providing not only basic literacy skills but also life skills. This program empowers marginalized individuals, promotes social inclusion, and offers them a chance to earn a formal diploma, leading to improved job prospects and increased self-esteem. Third, to ensure that school leaders and teachers are well-equipped to teach functional literacy, the Department of Education invests in teacher training and development programs. We contribute to the professional development of teachers through training programs, workshops, and seminars that enhance their teaching methods and keep them updated with the latest educational trends and approaches. Furthermore, DepEd actively collaborates with various organizations and stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, to promote functional literacy. These partnerships aid in the development of educational materials, access to resources, and the implementation of innovative teaching methods. Through the Literacy Coordinating Council (LCC), the Department of Education strengthens its commitment to work with legislators and local government units (LGUs) to strengthen relevant policies and literacy support structures at the grassroots level. To date, more than 300 Local LCCs have been established by LGUs, ensuring community literacy mapping out in identifying out-of-school children, youth, and adults, and provide relevant literacy program interventions. Recognizing the outstanding efforts of partners and stakeholders in community-based literacy development, the LCC has awarded more than 300 LGUs and NGOs through its National Literacy Awards (NLA) program. Let me highlight an inspiring success story from the NLA winners: the Municipality of Kauswagan in Lanao Del Norte. The LCC recognized their outstanding literacy intervention called the ""From Battle Ground to School Ground.” This program has seen a scaled-up response in skills and literacy in conflict-affected areas, transforming communities into productive zones with sustained peace. It has successfully engaged both Muslim and Christian individuals, young and old, and improved the lives of many. This story exemplifies the contributions of LGUs in improving literacy rates and making a difference in the lives of Filipinos. Moreover, the LCC has developed literacy-related policies, frameworks, standards, and tools based on extensive research and empirical evidence. With the support of the Philippine Normal University, research and development work of the LCC has flourished. The outputs include the National Literacy Framework, standards and monitoring and evaluation tools for exemplary community-based literacy programs, benchmarks for adult literacy competencies, and the National Literacy Information System (NLIS). The NLIS provides a platform for the Council, member agencies, stakeholders, partners, and literacy workers to access and utilize data for policy formulation and literacy program development at both national and local levels. While we have made substantial efforts to enhance functional literacy in our country, the journey is ongoing, and there are still challenges to be addressed. In order to address the challenges we face, we must prioritize the following actions: First, we need to ensure that access to quality education reaches even the most remote areas of our country. No Filipino should be left behind due to geographical limitations. We must invest in infrastructure, technology, and resources to bridge the education gap between urban and rural areas. This includes providing schools with the necessary tools and equipment, ensuring a conducive learning environment, and recruiting and training qualified teachers who are passionate about improving literacy rates. Second, we must focus on narrowing the literacy gap. While we have made progress in increasing literacy rates, there are still disparities among different regions and social groups. We need targeted interventions and programs to address these gaps and provide equal opportunities for all. This may involve implementing literacy programs specifically tailored to the needs of disadvantaged communities, offering scholarships and financial assistance to underprivileged students, and providing additional support and resources for learners with special needs. Third, we must adapt to the changing demands of the digital age. Technology has transformed the way we live, work, and learn. We must embrace this digital revolution and integrate digital literacy into our education system. This includes teaching students how to navigate information online, use digital tools for communication and collaboration, and develop critical thinking skills to evaluate digital content. As well as teaching them the the responsible and ethical use of Artificial Intelligence. By equipping our learners with digital literacy skills, we prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the future. We must continue to foster partnerships and collaborations. The Department of Education cannot achieve its goals alone. We need the support of NGOs, private sector organizations, and other stakeholders to create a comprehensive and sustainable approach to functional literacy. These partnerships can help us develop innovative solutions, share best practices, and leverage resources to reach more learners and communities. Maalala ko noong ako ay mayor ng syudad ng Davao. Doon ako natuto kung ano ang literacy dahil isa kami sa mga tiningnan ng Literacy Coordinating Council for recognition in the efforts to include literacy in our city. It is a holistic approach and it is a holistic look at how the city is developing in terms of literacy. Education is not solely a task for the government; it is a shared commitment among educators, parents, communities, and civil society. When a nation invests in education and promotes literacy among its people, it sets the stage for a peaceful and secure society. Education provides individuals with the tools to understand and resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner, fostering a culture of dialogue and tolerance. It equips them with critical thinking skills, enabling them to challenge extremism, discrimination, and other forms of social unrest. By promoting education and literacy, we empower individuals to become active and responsible citizens who contribute to the stability and harmony of a nation. Furthermore, education and literacy are essential for national security. A well-educated and literate population is more equipped to address the challenges and threats faced by a country. It enhances the capacity of individuals to understand and respond to national and global issues, such as climate change, economic instability, political conflicts, and more. Education also plays a vital role in building a strong defense force by producing skilled and knowledgeable individuals who can contribute to the security and defense sectors. Moreover, education and literacy are crucial components of economic development and prosperity. A literate and educated workforce is more likely to have higher employment rates, increased productivity, and better job opportunities. It creates a foundation for innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. By investing in education and promoting literacy, we are investing in the future of our country, unlocking the potential of our people, and paving the way for sustainable development and prosperity. In conclusion, education, literacy, and national security are interconnected pillars that contribute to peace, development, and prosperity in a nation. It is our collective responsibility to support and contribute to these efforts. As educators, parents, communities, and civil society, we must work hand in hand with the government to prioritize education, promote literacy, and ensure a secure and peaceful environment for all.

VPSD Speech for the Supreme Court of the Philippines - Philippine Trial Judges League Inc. 30th Pearl Anniversary,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-supreme-court-philippines-philippine-trial-judges-league-inc-30th-pearl-anniversary,2023-10-13,"EJK AND SEC. 16 OF THE 1987 PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION Supreme Court of the Philippines - Philippine Trial Judges League Inc. 30th Pearl Anniversary Cebu City Ladies and gentlemen, Today, we gather here to celebrate a momentous occasion - the 30th Pearl Anniversary of the Philippine Trial Judges League, Inc. It is with great joy and pride that I congratulate each and every one of you for reaching this remarkable milestone. Your unwavering commitment to the pursuit of justice and the rule of law has been a beacon of hope for the Filipino people. As we commemorate this special occasion, it is imperative that we reflect upon the challenges that lie ahead. One such challenge that we must confront is the failure of speedy administration of justice. The consequences of this failure are far-reaching and profound. It contributes to extra-judicial killings, the thirst for instant justice, and the dangerous trend of individuals taking matters into their own hands. We live in a society where the demand for justice is urgent and palpable. Citizens, tired of waiting for their cases to be resolved, become disillusioned with the justice system. They become desperate for resolution, for closure, and for retribution. This desperation, born out of a lack of timely justice, can manifest in dangerous ways. It can lead to a breakdown of trust in our institutions and the erosion of the very fabric of our society. It is thus our duty to rise to this challenge and address it head-on. We must strive to ensure that justice is not only served, but is served swiftly. We must work together to expedite the resolution of cases and restore faith in our justice system. By doing so, we can help prevent the rise of summary executions and the dangerous thirst for street justice. As the saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied. Every day that a case remains unresolved, the trust of our citizens in the system diminishes. As trial judges, you have the power to be catalysts for change by ensuring that cases are presided over in a timely and impartial manner. You are instruments in restoring the people’s faith in the system, and to prevent the tragic consequences that arise from a lack of speedy justice. As you celebrate this Pearl Anniversary, I trust that you continually embody the ideals and principles that your organization, the Philippine Trial Judges League, Inc. stands for. Let us all work together to strengthen our justice system, to ensure the speedy administration of justice, and to protect the rights of every Filipino citizen. Together, we can create a society where justice is not only served, but is served swiftly; where the thirst for instant justice is quenched by the fair and impartial resolution of cases. To close, I would like to once again congratulate the Philippine Trial Judges League, Inc. on your 30th Pearl Anniversary. Your dedication and commitment to fairness and equity have been an inspiration to all. As we move forward, let us embrace the challenges that lie ahead with renewed determination and resolve. Together, we can build a future where the rule of law reigns supreme. Mga kababayan, patuloy tayo maging MATATAG sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at mga Batang Makabansa. Ang lahat para sa Diyos, Bayan, at Pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for University of Perpetual Help System DALTA's 44th Commencement Exercises,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-university-perpetual-help-system-daltas-44th-commencement-exercises,2023-10-12,"EDUCATION AND AI University of Perpetual Help System DALTA 44th Commencement Exercises PICC,Pasay City Today marks the culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and unwavering commitment to education. As we stand on this stage, it is important to reflect on the significance of education and how it impacts society as a whole. Education is the cornerstone of progress and development. It empowers individuals, transforms communities, and shapes nations. It is through education that we acquire knowledge, critical thinking skills, and values that enable us to tackle the challenges of the world. As we delve deeper into the importance of education and its impact on society, we cannot ignore the advancements in technology that are shaping the way we learn, teach, and interact with knowledge. One such groundbreaking innovation that has gained tremendous momentum in recent years is the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). Just as education has long been recognized as a catalyst for progress, AI has the potential to revolutionize the educational landscape and redefine the way we acquire and apply knowledge. Its emergence has brought about a paradigm shift in education. It can personalize learning experiences, provide instant feedback, and enhance educational outcomes. However, it is crucial to remember that education is not about acquiring knowledge from machines, but about the growth and revival of a nation. Education ensures that we not only equip ourselves with skills and expertise but also develop a sense of responsibility towards our society. It is through education that we cultivate empathy, compassion, and a commitment to social justice. As we embrace the possibilities that artificial intelligence presents, we must also recognize the need for checks and balances. The government has a vital role to play in ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically. We must guard against the potential biases and inequalities that may arise from the use of AI in education. It is essential to strike a balance between embracing AI's capabilities and preserving the human touch in education. Let us remember that Artificial Intelligence is not meant to replace the learner but to enhance their abilities. It is a tool that can amplify our human capacity and enable us to reach new heights. We must harness the power of AI to foster creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among our students. In the ever-changing landscape of technology and the world of academia, we must strive for excellence in everything we do. As graduates, you have demonstrated exceptional dedication to your studies, and it is in this pursuit of excellence that will make a lasting impact on our society. Always remember to use your knowledge and skills to contribute to the betterment of our country. Be the catalysts for change, the innovators who shape the future of our beloved nation. Each field, whether it be medicine, business, engineering, or arts, holds the potential to create a lasting impact. It is up to you to nurture these seeds of excellence and watch them grow into a better future for our nation. As you embark on this next chapter of your lives, remember the value of education, the power of AI, and the responsibility that comes with it. There is a need for checks and balances, and AI is merely a tool to enhance our capacities as human beings, rather than replace them. Once again, I congratulate you as you step into a new world of possibilities. May you embrace every challenge and seize every opportunity. Lastly, may you be instrumental in creating a brighter, more prosperous future for our beloved country. Mga kababayan, patuloy tayo maging MATATAG sa pagtaguyod ng isang Bansang Makabata at mga Batang Makabansa. Ang lahat ng ating gingawa ay para sa Diyos, sa Bayan, at sa Pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
Vice President and Philippine Education Secretary Sara Z. Duterte’s Keynote Speech for the 2023 GEIS,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vice-president-and-philippine-education-secretary-sara-z-dutertes-keynote-speech-2023-geis,2023-09-21,"Vice President and Philippine Education Secretary Sara Z. Duterte’s Keynote Speech for the 2023 Global Education and Innovation Summit (GEIS) Seoul, South Korea September 21, 2023 Ladies and gentlemen, Assalamualaykum Annyeong Hasimnikka. Good morning, everyone. Joheun Achimibnida Yeoreobun. Let me express my sincere gratitude to the government of the Republic of Korea for bringing together world leaders and experts in the field of education through the Global Education and Innovation Summit. Education is a powerful resource, and I am humbled to be part of this gathering of education leaders and experts from all over the world, and blessed to be able to share this keynote. But I believe what is most important today is also the opportunity to learn from all of you. I have two observations which I believe have greatly affected education in the last twenty years. First is that never in the history of the world has information been so readily available – to students, parents, and educators because of technology. Education has vastly evolved from the traditional imparting of knowledge in classrooms, at home from parents, and from our respective social circles and communities. Education today must now exist side by side with technology, which continues to grow at an astoundingly rapid pace. Yuval Noah Harari said it best when he stated: “the last thing a teacher needs to give his or her pupils is more information. They already have far too much of it. Instead, people need the ability to make sense of the information, to tell the difference between what is important and unimportant, and above all, to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world.” And I add, it is equally important to teach children how to differentiate truthful information from the untrue, to know what contributes to a learner’s development and what does not, and what will instill in them the correct values that will turn them into productive citizens of their respective countries. Critical thinking has become more important than ever. The second observation I wish to put forth, is the threat of disruption in education. In my lifetime, I have witnessed one horrific disruption to education – the Covid 19 Pandemic. I share the same experience with many parents in facing the numerous educational challenges that were brought upon all of us by the pandemic. During the pandemic, most students in the Phillipines had to stay at home for their education, and I believe this deprived them the ease and function of communicative learning. Covid-19 also kept students away from school environments, which we know are conducive to fostering independent thought and activity. Further, the pandemic deprived many students of social interactions that are largely developed in school settings, which includes group work and collaboration. Disruptions in education are not limited to pandemics, but may be the result of other causes such as areas in conflict, lack of infrastructure or human resource, or even as common as inclement weather. These two observations highlight four specific things that we must focus on when speaking about education in the twenty first century and digital education – critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These four elements are widely considered by experts as the pillars of modern education. And should remain the same in digital education where the learning environment departs from our traditional classrooms. Last night, I was editing the keynote message for this morning. And I was telling my colleague, “Why are we editing this keynote? Shouldn’t we use AI to edit this keynote at this hour?” And then my colleague said, “Sshh, someone might hear you.” It appeared to me that AI evokes shame, evokes fear – because of the unknown. We now live in an era where undeniably, technology must be harnessed to improve access, quality and equality in education. And the advent of artificial intelligence will certainly create another paradigm shift in education. While this possibility will present newer and greater opportunities, it will also present many uncertainties in our vision of digital education. And so we propose the following: First, the paramount consideration whenever and wherever we use technology should wrap around critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. Second, we must be responsive to the effects of technology in our educational systems. This means recognizing quickly what is not working and change it, to continuously improve even if it is a success and to always keep in mind that the most important result is not the technology itself, but how it affects the development of our learners; and Lastly, adaptability and sustainability of new technology in education systems must be studied by the end users before implementation. This is in line with the thought that government programs and policies should be designed according to the behavior of people. We must recognize that some technologies may work for one ecosystem, but it may not work for others. It is the teachers and students who will be using it that will determine its effectivity. Adam Grant famously once said “that the greatest leaders don’t necessarily have the best expertise but sought out the broadest perspectives.” He further said that “the more options one gathers, the higher the probability of choosing the best option.” I believe this is the reason why we are all gathered here today. Let us take this opportunity to reshape education in our respective countries in order to provide our learners the all-important opportunity of reaching their full potential. The ultimate result of all our efforts should be the molding of productive and peaceful global citizens, equipped with 21st century skills, but with a heart for nation- building. Ang lahat ng ating ginagawa ay para sa Diyos, bayan at pamilya. All the things we do, is for God, country and family. Kamsahamnida. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for National Teacher’s Month Kick-Off,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-national-teachers-month-kick-,2023-09-05,"VPSD Speech for National Teacher’s Month Kick-Off, Bohol Wisdom School Gymnasium, Tagbilaran City Event Date: September 5, 2023 Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong buntag kaninyong tanan. Good morning to everyone. I stand before you today as we gather to begin National Teacher’s Month, feeling incredibly humbled and encouraged by the personal encounters that have shaped my respect for teachers. You probably already know that my family on both sides has been in the teaching profession for generations. Teachers built the foundation of who I am as a Filipino in many ways. Ang akoang mama, teacher siya kaniadto sa high school, aduna pa’y typing class kaniadto — “The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Wala na ko kaabot sa typing class kay pag abot nako og high school, computer classes na, pero naka-check ko og papers sa akong mama. Nagatudlo siya og Rizal, Typing Class, og Commerce sa high school mao nang tig-check ko kaniadto. Ang amoang eskwelahan kaniadto, aduna siya’y college department. So pag moanhi ko sa college department, makit-an nako ang mga estudyante sa akong mama. Elementary paman ko ato, siguro naa pa sa mga 7, 8 – kay nihunong ug tudlo akong mama 9 years old ko kay nabuntis siya sa among kinamanghuran. I know I am not the only one who has absorbed the fundamental life principles of teachers. Many of us here who have become respected teachers, doctors, lawyers, business leaders, public servants, entrepreneurs, and all other professionals nurtured our dreams with the help of a teacher. Many dreams started inside the classrooms. Many dreams were inspired by teachers. Teachers are the spark of inspiration in every classroom, the guiding light of countless possibilities and better futures, and the builders of our nation’s dreams. Teachers have essentially helped build our country. And teachers will always be there as we move forward with our aspirations to see a stable, secure, peaceful, and strong motherland. We are a fascinating country with a rich history and culture. We have a strong, educated middle class. We have a young and vibrant labor force. For the most part, it is because of the teachers who labored, sacrificed, and dedicated their lives to ensuring that we are raising educated, learned, and skilled citizens. Beyond teaching reading, writing, and numeracy, we are grateful for the life lessons you teach our children. Mao nang permi gyud ko magpahinumdom sa atong mga magtutudlo kung naa ko’y maistorya na always be kind sa inyohang mga estudyante kay tungod kung unsa na ilang isulti sa ilang mga studyante karon, mao na ang ilang mahinumdomam permi. They do not remember the lessons. They do not remember the exams. They only remember kanang mga sakit nga mga words na gisulti sa ilaha. So if you have the opportunity to talk to your learners, always be kind with your words and actions. Not too long ago, teachers played a crucial role in shaping the character of our learners. Hand in hand with parents and the community, teachers have inculcated in our children the values that have essentially formed our identity as Filipinos. Ang pagiging magalang. Ang pagiging masinop. Ang pagiging matulungin. Ang pagiging mapagmahal. Ang pagkakaroon ng takot sa Diyos o kay Allah. Bakit mahalaga ang respeto sa kapwa. Bakit mahalaga ang pagtanggap natin sa iba — sa kabila ng kanilang kalagayan sa buhay, relihiyon, tribo, o kasarian. Bakit mahalaga ang pagpapatawad. Ano ang kahalagahan ng disiplina. Paano natin maipapakita na mahal natin ang ating bayan. These are just some of the values many of us have learned in school from our teachers. Unfortunately, these had been sidestepped by some efforts supposedly designed to improve our curriculum. But with the revised K to 10 curriculum, which we now call the MATATAG Curriculum, we are reintroducing Good Manners and Right Conduct to our learners. For many learners, GMRC may be something new and totally different, if not strange. We hope to once again make our schools and classrooms places where learners can essentially acquire values to help them become better individuals. This is crucial because our learners are growing up in a world that is increasingly violent, unsafe, and unfriendly to children. By imparting moral values to young Filipinos at a young age, we equip them with the tools necessary to make sound decisions as adults. And we entrust this to you, our beloved teachers. We know that our public school teachers have been burdened with many challenges that come with the profession. And it has been so since the 1940s. The Department of Education’s MATATAG Agenda is not just a slogan. It is our roadmap to institutionalizing reforms within the Department. This includes the protection of your rights and the promotion of your welfare. Many of our school teachers are overly stressed about their financial insecurities. That is why we are regularly engaging with GSIS. We are looking to address your concerns over accrued interests or arrears of your loans. Kada bulan, duna mi meeting with GSIS to make sure na tanan among gina request sa ilaha, malihok within their institution. The Department of Education is fully committed to enhancing your capacities. The initiatives for in-service teachers and the continuous professional development programs bear testimony to this. Under the leadership of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., we have collaborated closely with the Department of Budget and Management, or DBM, to approve positions for 3,500 administrative officers and 1,500 PDOs to alleviate the administrative burden on our beloved teachers. Last week, DBM approved and released the AO 11 and PDO 1 positions. And President Marcos has seen the importance of this DBM approved and released AO 11 and PDO 1 positions. Soon, you will be relieved of the administrative responsibilities that prevent you from focusing on enhancing our students' learning. Still, there's more to come. With the vetted guidelines by both DBM and the Civil Service Commission, we are requesting a higher allocation for teaching overload pay. We can never put a monetary value on your contributions to the country. Rest assured that we are committed to recognizing and compensating our teachers for their invaluable contributions. We will always advocate for teacher benefits as your champions. We have always placed immense value on continuous learning, not just for our students but for our educators. As we move towards a more resilient basic education sector, trainings on blended learning and tools to integrate technology in the classroom will ensure our educators are equipped with the tools they need to succeed. DepEd’s vision is to provide innovative, long-term solutions to basic education challenges. These initiatives are a testament to our understanding of your challenges and our determination to ensure you can focus on what you do best—teaching. As we start this month-long celebration, let me reiterate what I have already told you in the past. Malaki po ang respeto ko sa inyo. And I am humbled standing before your presence as I also stand with pride that I am tasked to lead Filipino professionals who are considered the bedrock of any society. Ang buong buwan na ito ay magsisilbing paalala sa inyong kahalagahan sa buhay ng bawat Pilipino at sa kinabukasan ng ating bansa. But please remember that the nation’s gratitude and profound appreciation for our educators do not end on the last day of September. The Philippines has thrived, not just because of its resources but also because of individuals who have nurtured our most precious resource, the Filipino youth. Our nation owes an immense debt to its educators. Your resilience, especially in these challenging times, is extraordinary. You are our children’s mentors, guides, and, sometimes, their biggest cheerleaders. As we look to the future, we rely on our teachers to implement the MATATAG Curriculum effectively. The curriculum aims to revolutionize how we approach education in the Philippines. MATATAG is a testament to our commitment to bolstering the foundation of our education system. As we pilot this and gear up for a national rollout, the heart of its success lies with you, our educators. The success of our reform agenda is deeply linked to your dedication and the ability to adapt and embrace challenges. Every change we bring and every reform we initiate is only as substantial as our teachers’ belief in its potential. At this point, allow me to recognize our private sector partners who have contributed to improving basic education in the Philippines. Among them is the Metrobank Foundation. Thank you for always supporting the Department and constantly promoting education's value. We are grateful for your financial support, provision of school supplies and uniforms for learners from low-income families, and your funding for constructing and rehabilitating public school classrooms, libraries, and other facilities in your adopted schools. Akoa lang isa-isahon ang mga miyembro sa atong National Teachers’ Month Council – ang Metrobank Foundation, DILG, BDO Foundation, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education, TESDA, GSIS, Landbank, Home Development New Fund, SSS, PhilHealth, Philpost, MMDA, Datu Balani Foundation, GMA Network, Smart Foundation, Globe Telecom, and Philippine Business for Education. Daghang salamat kaninyong tanan. As I draw my message to a close, let us recognize our shared duty to cultivate an environment that champions lifelong learning and workforce development. The reforms introduced by the MATATAG Agenda are not solely about embracing new curricula or innovative methodologies. They also create a space where our teachers feel genuinely appreciated, our students are inspired and empowered, and our nation can confidently march towards a more prosperous, competitive, and resilient future. To every teacher here and those across the archipelago, I wish you unparalleled rewards and satisfaction in your noble profession. Your impact extends beyond classroom walls and resonates deeply in the hearts and minds of those you guide. To the rest of us, our role is clear: stand alongside our teachers and offer support, understanding, encouragement, and respect. As we dedicate this month to our teachers, let us also take this as an opportunity for renewed commitment, growth, and positive change. So maghatag lang ko ug good news. Unang-una, pag muadto mi sa skwelahan mag school visit mi unya ang trabaho nako makigstorya sa mga estudyante. Unya amoa nang panguhaon ang mga maestra akoang ipaistorya sa Assistant Secretary sa DepEd. Unya didto sa classroom, mangutana ko kung but-an ba na si ma’am o dili? Wala’y binuang, naa gyuy bata muingon. Mao na ana ko, be kind kay kita pud moestorya baya ta sa atong mga maestra, ‘di ba? Lain pud kung kita ang maistoryahan. So, ang isa sa mga gina-reklamo pag mag-storya na sa mga maestra didto kay ang admin tasks lagi daw. Unya balik ko sa Central Office didto sa HR. Ana ko, miskan asa mi moadto na skwelahan, magbalik-balik man gyud ang reklamo sa admin tasks. Unsa man gyu’y tinuod? Naa ta’y administrative officer, naa pa’y moabot. Unsa man gyu’y ginareklamo na admin task? Ana ko sa iya, “pila man kabuok ang ginapabuhat na admin tasks sa maestra? 56? 56 kabuok?” Unya giingnan nako siya na, “ma’am, kanang 56 ninyo kabuok na admin tasks ba, naa man na siya’y basehan sa balaod. Kung wala ni siya’y basehan sa balaod, nganong ipabuhat mana ninyo sa kuan… sa mga maestra na wala ma’y basehan na sila ang mobuhat ana.” Unya, niingon siya, “sige. Maglingkod mi somewhere, legal, moagi mi og review.” Gitagaan namo siya’g adlaw, kalooy sa Ginoo, wala gihapon siya nahuman. Pero duna siya’y update kadtong nag meeting mi. Niingon siya, ang 56 kuno, nahimo nilang 11 nalang kabuok administrative tasks ang naa’y basehan na ang maestra gyud ang mubuhat. So from 56 to 11 interim guidelines issued so that dili mo lat-an sa division sa pagpangayo sa kung unsa man nang ginapangayo nila. So Interim guidelines will be issued, significantly and immediately reducing admin tasks of teachers. End of School Year Rites was already included into the official school days of the current school calendar. So dili siya mogawas sa school days ang end of school year rites. We made sure that in this year’s school calendar, teachers will have 30 straight days of rest during the break without any DepEd activity that requires volunteer works. All activities with voluntary participation is scheduled after the said 30-day break. So katong DepEd memorandum na naa didto ang school calendar, makita ninyo dunay 30 days dito na wala’y nakabutang na activity. And we intend to release a memo sa atoang regions, divisions, sa atoang school heads and principals na they must answer if gipa-report ang teacher during the 30 days break. And then, we are about to sign a MOA with GSIS with a dedicated and exclusive lane for teachers in all branches. There will be an assigned team in GSIS to exclusively handle teacher concerns. We are about to launch a website that will provide free legal aid for teachers in terms of loan contracts. Wala nang palakasan. We are now developing an automated system for an objective selection in the hiring and promotion of teachers. Happy National Teachers Month, kaninyong tanan. Magmadasigon kita sa atong tinguha nga itukod ang usa ka nasud nga mobarog sa kabataan ug mga kabataan nga moalagad sa atong nasud. Ang tanan alang sa Diyos, sa nasud, ug sa matag pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
"VPSD Speech for the Opening of the Philippine Book Festival, SMX Convention Center, SM Davao",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-opening-philippine-book-festival-smx-convention-center-sm-davao,2023-08-18,"Event Date: August 18, 2023, at 8:00 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong buntag kaninyong tanan. Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat. I am delighted to join you today to emphasize the importance of the second and last installment of the First Philippine Book Festival. We are fortunate to host this event in our beloved city in time for the Kadayawan Festival. To all our guests, welcome to Davao City. This event exemplifies the National Book Development Board’s unwavering dedication to Filipino students. At the same time, this highlights the dedication and achievements of everyone in the Philippine publishing industry. The importance of your work is something that we cannot overemphasize — and the same can also be said about the significance of the books authored by people who have dedicated their lives to the profession and advocacy of sharing their expert or academic knowledge with others, giving inspiration to others, or entertaining others through their stories—fiction or non-fiction. This is also important for the Department of Education. Recently, we launched the MATATAG Curriculum with great emphasis on basic competencies, including writing, reading—and comprehension. Over the past few years, we have seen a painful decline in the ability of our young learners to read and write. The MATATAG Curriculum is a revised and improved version of the K to 10 program. It hopes to correct the previous program’s flaws that affected our learners’ writing and reading skills—contributing to learning losses. Our direction is not only for our learners to possess the power of writing and reading—but, most importantly, for them to value this power as it could help them navigate life successfully. Our campaign necessitates rekindling our learners’ interest in the written word through reading books and other materials that could ignite their curiosity, give space for their creativity, and nurture their intellect. We intend to offer our learners accurate, responsive, and culturally relevant reading materials. Books and other related reading materials could change lives. And through books and other related and relevant reading materials, we want to change the lives of our learners. This Book Festival is more than gathering our finest book writers, book readers and collectors, illustrators, agents, and publishers. This is a strong assertion of the role of books in our lives as individuals and as a nation. It’s a celebration of the infinite areas of learning that may be accessed by turning the pages of a book. Through workshops, exhibits, and storytelling sessions, we craft an immersive “book experience” that embraces families, visitors, and children. On this occasion, we also pay tribute to the richness of our culture, history, and language. Each piece of literature is a testament to the depth of Filipino thought, imagination, and narrative. By promoting our homegrown authors, illustrators, and publishers, we not only give voices to stories that have been waiting to be told for so long—we also celebrate them. Through the First Philippine Book Festival, let us stand united in our dedication to fostering lifelong learning and a culture that embraces diversity, empowers minds, and sparks the flames of imagination. Let us also take this opportunity to honor the legacy of our literary pioneers and those yet to come. Let us nurture the seeds of knowledge that, when planted today, will yield a bountiful harvest for generations to come. May this festival illuminate our path toward a strong Philippines—where the pages of our shared story are etched with the enduring ink of knowledge, wisdom, and inspiration. Maging MATATAG tayo tungo sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Lahat—para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa Pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."

(ALSWDOPI) 26th National Convention and General Assembly, SMX Convention Center, Davao City Event Date: August 15, 2023, at 8:00 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat. Thank you to the Association of Local Social Welfare and Development Officers of the Philippines, Inc. for inviting me to your 26th National Convention and General Assembly. To be a part of your gathering is truly an honor and an opportunity for me… Honor — knowing your indispensable role in advancing our people's welfare, in fighting for the protection of their rights, and in championing life and a society where there is justice, hope, and dignity. And an opportunity — as I wish to express my admiration for your extraordinary gift to change people’s lives and empower communities to rise from the rubbles of adversities with renewed enthusiasm, strength, and resilience. Social workers. The foot soldiers for social change. How you surrendered your lives to that special calling to serve other people, to help communities — without any conditions — is truly inspiring. Karapat-dapat lang na tingnan at pag-aralan ang inyong buhay at propesyon…at pamarisan lalim ng pagmamahal ninyo sa inyong kapwa at sa inyong bayan. Gusto ko pong ipaalam sa inyo na mataas ang respeto ko sa inyo at sa inyong ginagawa. Sumasaludo po ako sa inyo — kagaya ng pagsaludo ko sa iba pang mga sektor na nagsasakripisyo at nagbubuwis ng kanilang buhay para mapagsilbihan ang kapwa Pilipino at matulungan ang mga komunidad na malampasan ang anumang krisis. Ni hindi pa man humuhupa ang bagyo, may mga social workers na naka-deploy sa mga lugar na nasalanta nito. Social workers din ang laging kasama ng mga search and rescue personnel pagkatapos ng lindol. Sa panahon ng gyera, mga social workers din ang kadalasang nakikita sa mga evacuation centers na nagsasagawa ng trauma healing sa mga batang bakwit. Ang takbuhan ng mga battered wives ay mga social workers. Ang sumbungan ng mga batang biktima ng pang-aabusong sekswal at pisikal ay mga social workers. I remember in 2016 when I was reelected as Mayor of Davao City — we were crushed by the tragic death of a boy who died after his stepfather repeatedly beat him. Kean Gabriel was only 3 when he died because of the brutality of an adult who was supposed to provide him with love, care, and safety. Nalaman ko na may iba pang minors na namatay dahil sa pagmamaltrato ng kanilang mga magulang o guardians sa mga komunidad. I said — we need to stop these cases of child abuse that could lead to more deaths. We decided to put up a hotline called The Kean Gabriel Hotline to encourage community members to report incidents of child abuse. And they can report anonymously. We chose a number that could easily be remembered — 0908 818 4444. And we produced a jingle played repeatedly on almost all radio stations in Davao — if only to remind the public of our shared responsibility to ensure that no child will again die because of abuse. The Kean Gabriel Hotline receives calls and messages 24/7. And behind the hotline are social workers. Over time, with the active involvement of the community in the Kean Gabriel advocacy, our social workers noticed a dramatic drop in reports. The hotline remains active even today. And I must say that without the help and dedication of the social workers and their hearts for abuse victims, we could have failed Kean Gabriel once again. We first failed Kean Gabriel when we failed to stop the abuse that resulted in his death. We did not want to fail in giving him justice. And then fail again to save other children from tragically dying from abusive adults. Let me also cite the help — and through the ongoing lobbying of social workers and child rights groups — in our decision to put up the Special Office for Children’s Concern under the Office of the City Mayor in 2019. The Office is tasked to implement programs related to children alone. At the Office of the Vice President today, social workers play crucial roles in implementing all social services projects. They are the frontline providers of services to the public — present in the Central Office and all 10 Satellite Offices of the OVP in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. One of the special projects of OVP now being handled by skilled social workers is the Mag Negosyo Ta ‘Day. Gusto ko pong bigyang diin na ang liderato ni Pangulong Bongbong Marcos ay hindi po magkukulang sa pagsusumikap na mabigyan ng tulong ang ating mga kababayan na nangangailangan…at maiahon ang mga mahihirap na komunidad. This gathering’s theme reminds me of the power of being united. I am happy that we share the same vision of advancing social change despite conflicting principles and clashing politics. During the election, our battle cry was unity. The significance of unity and being united for a common cause — this time social change — is something that we cannot overemphasize today. Maging MATATAG tayo tungo sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Lahat— para sa Diyos, bayan, at bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for the Launch of the MATATAG K to 10 Curriculum,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-launch-matatag-k-10-curriculum,2023-08-10,"VPSD Speech for the Launch of the MATATAG K to 10 Curriculum Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila Event Date: August 10, 20233, at 2:00 pm Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GUESTS] Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, esteemed educators, our partners and all education stakeholders, and our dear learners, a warm welcome to all… Thank you. Thank you to all of you who contributed time, resources, knowledge, and expertise to the Department of Education’s efforts to bring about the most needed reforms in our basic education and improve the learning efficiency of our children. Your help and support are truly important to DepEd and to the success of the reform agenda. The entire Department is grateful to know that we are not alone in our mission. Your role and contributions are deeply valued. You are deeply valued. The past years showed us the alarmingly poor performance of Filipino learners in national and international assessments. This brought to light questions on the effectiveness of the K to 10 curriculum. One of the issues discovered was that — the curriculum was overloaded with too many lessons or subjects. The curriculum required instructors to teach an excessive number of learning competencies — with very limited time available for instruction. Both teachers and learners were overburdened with lessons and other school tasks and activities. The result was devastating for our learners. It compromised their mastery of fundamental skills such as reading and solving simple math problems. These issues, along with other existing factors and conditions, contributed to our learning losses. And to avert further learning losses, the curriculum had to undergo necessary revisions. And today, we are happy to announce the completion of the review of the K to 10 curriculum. And we are also happy to announce that today, we officially launch the K to 10 curriculum, and we will call this — The MATATAG curriculum. Started during the time of former DepEd Secretary Liling Briones under the Duterte Administration, the review was an extensive and painstaking process that demanded the collaboration of education stakeholders. The review and revisions fulfill the Department of Education's pledge to evaluate the K to 12 program following its initial implementation. The curriculum’s component covering senior high school program is currently being reviewed. Among the revisions in the K to 10 program include reducing the number of competencies. DepEd will give greater emphasis on the development of foundational skills such as literacy, numeracy, and socio-emotional skills to our Kinder to Grade 3 learners. The formation of our learners' values and the development of their characters will be intensified — in adherence to RA 11476 or the GMRC and Values Education Act of 2020. The curriculum also features clearer articulation of 21st-century skills. This next feature holds a very special place in my heart. The new K to 10 curriculum will integrate peace competencies — highlighting the promotion of non-violent actions and the development of conflict-resolution skills in learners. For after all, there is security, there is peace. This curriculum will be integral to DepEd’s MATATAG Agenda, unveiled in January this year. DepEd’s track remains to be fundamentally illuminated by the wisdom behind our slogan MATATAG: Bansang Makabata, Batang Makabansa. Meaning — DepEd's programs and reforms are intentionally tailored to produce competent, job-ready, active, responsible, and patriotic citizens. I want to thank Secretary Liling Briones for her bold action and leadership. Binuksan ni Sec. Liling ang daan ng pagbabago na tinatahak natin ngayon para sa ating mga mag-aaral. Pursuing these reforms has been marked by foresight and demonstrated DepEd’s desire to change the learning landscape of the Philippines for the sake of the future of our learners. Let me emphasize that the new curriculum is a labor of love between DepEd and international and local academics, the private sector, government agencies, and education stakeholders. It is designed to help improve the learning outcomes of our children and help them succeed in life. We are optimistic that this will provide our children with a meaningful learning experience that will boost their intelligence, improve their knowledge, enhance their skills and talents, and prepare them to become well-rounded, mature individuals. Allow me please to elaborate on and walk you through the MATATAG curriculum — which is now at the heart of the Department of Education. MA — stands for Makabagong kurikulum na napapanahon. The knowledge that we are offering our learners should be relevant, and the skills being developed are applicable and responsive to the demands of a world that constantly evolves. But while doing this, our MATATAG curriculum will reintroduce the basic foundation of education to our learners — the literacy and numeracy competencies The MATATAG curriculum will ensure that in our schools, learners will master their literacy and numeracy skills. But we also hope that in their homes, our young learners will get additional coaching or teaching from the adult members of the household. We encourage families to revive the culture of coaching at home to complement our school-based efforts. TA — Stands for Talino na mula sa isip at puso. It is important that our learners are mentally prepared to face the challenges of the world and equally important that they are also emotionally ready to navigate its complexities. We shall promote a balance between intelligence of the mind and maturity of the heart. Our progressive and holistic approach to education fosters creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, adaptability, and digital and media literacy. These are essential skills needed to thrive and succeed in contemporary society. However, we understand that genuine and lasting wisdom is a matter of the heart. We shall cultivate in the hearts of our learners the values necessary for developing their characters so that they become responsible, compassionate, and better individuals. TA — Stands for Tapang na humarap sa ano man ang hamon sa buhay. We will harness our deep sense of identity as Filipinos in facing uncertainties and adversities as a nation. From this streams our courage and strength, resilience, and readiness to unite with fellow Filipinos to take on any challenges that demand collective actions. Additionally, from this, we hope to witness our learners grow into patriotic citizens. G — Stands for Galing ng Pilipino, nangingibabaw sa mundo. We aim to produce learners who are ready and equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills needed for them to shine on the competitive world stage. The Filipino diaspora is characterized by various realities — but ultimately, Filipinos would always find a way not only to fit in but also to claim the spotlight of excellence — inspiring national pride. Meanwhile, the MATATAG curriculum will be brought to all Filipino learners — it will serve as the core curriculum for all learners catered to by various inclusion programs such as the Indigenous Peoples Education Program, the Madrasah Education Program, Special Needs Education, and the Alternative Learning System. Today, we officially introduced the MATATAG curriculum to you. It is a significant leap towards a better, more promising future for our learners. It offers a glowing promise in our campaign to improve the country’s basic education as it brings to life our dreams and aspirations for our learners and our country. But it demands the extraordinary dedication, commitment, support, and resolve of our education stakeholders. I call on all our teachers and all school officials across the country to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of the program. Let the MATATAG Curriculum become a testament to our faith, love, hard work, and hope for our children's future. Together, let us embrace this transformative change. For our children. For their future. Mga kababayan, patuloy tayong maging MATATAG para sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Ang lahat po ng ating ginagawa ay para sa Diyos, sa bayan at sa pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran!"

VPSD Speech for OVP Pride Reception,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-ovp-pride-reception,2023-06-16,"Event Date: June 15, 2023, at 10:00 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong buntag kaninyong tanan. Good morning to everyone. Today, it is with great pride and excitement that the Office of the Vice President hosts its first LGBTQI+ Pride Month reception. We are joined here today by LGBTQI+ leaders from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao who are part of LGBT Pilipinas to celebrate the diverse colors of our Rainbow. We are also joined by some of our partner local government leaders, our staunchest LGBTQI+ rights supporters who have championed equality in their respective localities, and representatives and leaders of government and civil society organizations — unang una na po si Congresswoman Geraldine and Atty. Harry. We join the global celebration of Pride Month with a sense of optimism and concrete action to truly empower our LGBTQI + sector. In the Philippines, just like many parts of the world, your sector could be among those with many members who have limited opportunities for livelihood or employment. Nakakabilib nga lang kayo — kasi masyado kayong maparaan, maabilidad, at responsable. Mayroon akong isang nanay na nakausap at ang kanyang anak ay isang gay person. Tinanong ko siya, sabi ko, “Ano ang pakiramdam mo as a mother na mayroon kang anak na gay, at alam naman natin na mayroon pa sa ating society ang hindi tanggap ang mga LGBT.” Sabi niya, “Alam mo, hindi ko tinitingnan ang aking mga anak as lalake, babae, bakla, o tomboy — tinitingnan ko ang aking anak sa kanyang puso. Aanhin mo pa ang anak na lalake kung adik naman.” Hindi ninyo hinahayaan na ang inyong mga pamilya ay magutom, marami sa inyo ay breadwinners — kahit na mahirap ang buhay. Ibang klase kayong mag-sakripisyo. Ibang klase kayong magmahal. Sa kabilang banda, sa kabila ng mga hamon ng buhay, mayroon kayong kakayahan na mapagaan ito. Sa panahon ng kalungkutan, nagbibigay kayo ng kasiyahan. Ang sabi nga nila — ang boring siguro ng buhay kung walang LGBT. But hindi lang tayo sa kasiyahan, we should not forget that more needs to be done to advance LGBTQI+ inclusion and equality in all sectors, including the business sector. LGBTQI+ people already face enough obstacles on their own, but to sustain their enterprises and expand their businesses, they are far more likely to encounter issues that are specific to underserved and marginalized groups. Our LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to systemic discrimination. They experience obstacles when attempting to access funds, licenses, produce sales, hire staff, or obtain insurance, in addition to not feeling safe going out or exploring business prospects consistent with their identity. Ngunit hindi lang ito sa negosyo. Kanina, kwento sa akin ni Cong. Geraldine na humihingi sila ng tulong sa Department of Education dahil may isang learner na hindi pinasali sa graduation dahil babae na siya at nakasuot siya ng pambabae. Very recently, I attended a graduation ceremony at ako ‘yung Commencement Speaker nila. I see among the graduates that there were outside the closet na members ng LGBTQI+ na graduates. Sa generation kasi natin, we are very resilient. ‘Yung mga kabataan ngayon, medyo hindi pa matibay ‘yung kanilang loob maybe because of the way they were brought up. Sabi ko sa kanila na of course, we all want respect and acceptance. But if you are not accepted, just choose happiness. Don’t think about your gender anymore, piliin mo lang kung saan ka masaya. Nakita ko silang nag smile and I hope na tumatak ‘yung message sa kanila, and I hope they remember it as they go to college, as they experience the challenges in higher education, and of course, beyond their college education. Together, we join the global commemoration of LGBTQI+ Pride Month with concrete actions to help this marginalized sector through our special project, Mag Negosyo 'Ta Day. Napakahalaga sa amin na makakampanya sa inyo ng entrepreneurship dahil makakatulong talaga ang mga Micro and Small Medium Enterprises sa dagdag na kita ng mga pamilya. As you already know, I started this entrepreneurship program when I was still Mayor. Sinimulan namin ito sa aming mga kababaihan dahil nakikita natin na nakauhalian na nasa bahay lang nagbabantay ng bata at natitipid ang kanilang pamilya sa kung anong nabibigay ng kanilang mga asawa. At karamihan pa sa kanila ay mga solo parents din. Apart from our agenda for inclusivity and equality, we also pushed for the LGBTQI+ community’s important role in advancing the growth of our local commerce by providing them with platforms that will enable them to showcase their creativity and resourcefulness. Sana naman sa susunod na mga taon, mayroon na tayong exhibit ng iba’t ibang mga naging negosyo natin. It is crucial that we steadfastly advocate for their further empowerment and collaboration among the business community so they can better keep up with growth opportunities within the private sector. As socio-economic disparities across genders continue to rise, we believe in the importance of expanding the capacities of the sector, thereby instituting programs that will not only narrow the economic gaps among genders but will also help them contribute to the overall growth of their respective industries. Hence, the Mag Negosyo Ta ‘Day aims to address the needs of diverse groups and sectors that are most victimized by poverty, injustice, and calamities by integrating them into the mainstream economy, so they become self-reliant, and empowered citizens of the country thereby, we become a strong nation. But we do not want it tulad ng nagbibigay ng entrepreneurial assistance tapos hindi marunong gumamit o hindi marunong mag negosyo ang recipients. Ang nangyayari, nahuhulog lang na binabayad ang pera sa mga utang nila, or nauubos lang din dahil hindi sila marunong mag manage ng pera. We have partnered with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation to give recipients of the Mag-Negosyo Ta ‘Day funds the technical and financial literacy and training needed for their projects to become sustainable. For a time now, the buzzword we often hear around us is “sustainability.” In Tagalog — tatagal o mananatili sa mahabang panahon. In the Visayan language — molahutay o modugay. ‘Yan ang gusto nating mangyari sa inyong mga proyekto. Nakikita natin na after six years, lumaki ang ang inyong mga negosyo. We want you — I want you to succeed and to grow. Dahil ang tagumpay ng inyong negosyo ay magiging tagumpay ng pamilya at magiging tagumpay ng inyong komunidad. We want to see your sector become government partners in responding to many interrelated social needs and issues in the community. Issues such as poverty, the proliferation of illegal drugs in our communities, or the dangers brought about by insurgency and terror groups like the New People’s Army to our children. Nakikiusap ako sa inyo na paniguraduhin natin na ang ating mga anak, ating mga kapatid, mga pamangkin, at mga kabataan sa ating komunidad na pumapasok sa mga paaralan na ipaintindi natin sa kanila na edukasyon ang magpapabago sa kanilang buhay. When we say education, hindi lang college degree. Mayroon rin pong technical skills dahil marami ring trabaho ang hindi na kailangan ng diploma. The Marcos administration is counting on your contribution to the growth of our nation. At this point, allow me to acknowledge the presence of leaders and members of our Mag Negosyo 'Ta Day LGBTQI+ beneficiaries. These are the following: Alima LGBT Federation from Pagadian City, Zamboanga del Sur Palauig LGBT Federation from Palauig, Zambales Maris ti Ayat LGBT Federation from Vigan City, Ilocos Sur Philippine Federation of Local Councils of Women (PFLCW) Each of the first three organizations will receive a grant of 150 thousand pesos, while the PFLCW will receive 300 thousand pesos. We are optimistic that through proper and more empowered representation, access to capital for MSME entrepreneurs from the LGBTQI+ community will be expanded and innovatively developed. Along with this, I hope that more groups will support through skills training, mentoring programs, and regular workshops and immersions. Sana ‘yung mga successful members natin ay tutulungan ang mga start-ups na gustong magkanegosyo. While we wait patiently for the passage of the SOGIE Bill, ang sasabihin ko nalang ay good things take time. But we have advocates in the government kasama na ako na sumusuporta sa batas ng proteksyon. Let us continue to press on in our shared cause for gender equality and social empowerment through avenues that will promote entrepreneurial collaboration and advancement across diverse socio-economic industries. May our civil society partners, such as LGBT Pilipinas, work hand in hand with the government in translating socio-civic causes into concrete reforms that will usher in thousands of LGBTQI+ group members toward viable entrepreneurial opportunities for growth. As we sail the unchartered rainbows of inclusivity, let us remind ourselves that the youth are looking at us. Together, let us push for the LGBTQI+ community’s wider participation in our collective nation-building efforts. Tayo po ay magiging MATATAG. Tungo sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. Lahat - para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
"VPSD Speech for Insurgency-Free Davao City First Anniversary Celebration, Rizal Park, Davao City",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-insurgency-free-davao-city-first-anniversary-celebration-rizal-park-davao-city,2023-05-24,"Event Date and Time: May 24, 2023, at 9:00 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. One year ago today, we Dabawenyos claimed our freedom. Freedom from the shackles of a group that has, for decades, through a bloody armed struggle, perpetuated a cycle of violence that trapped many poor Filipino families, especially those living in the countryside such as our lumad brothers and sisters. Freedom from the war inspired by a deranged ideology and the delusion that they can topple the government, take over, and rule the nation. New People’s Army. These are three words that, as much as possible, I once avoided mentioning. Why because I did not want to dignify its presence or acknowledge the monstrosity of its terrorist acts over the past 53 years. I thought that mentioning “New People’s Army” added more air into their swollen state of madness and encouraged them to unleash more destruction and death and string another cycle of violence for the people to suffer from. But I realized that we needed to speak of the devil. But speak of the devil not with fear but with the resolve, the bravery, the tenacity of real patriots determined to defend our fellow Filipinos, particularly our children, and our homeland. We needed to speak of the devil if only to defeat the devil. And we did. Our story in the Paquibato District is one for the books. It is a shining example of a successful anti-terrorism campaign made possible by the collaboration of various sectors through the program Peace 911 by the local government of Davao. And let me just make a special mention to the person who created Peace 911 and we, Davaoeños, will forever be grateful for the passion to work on peace not only in Davao City but the entire country — Ma’am Inday Irene Santiago. Daghan kaayong salamat, ma’am for all the work that you do for our country. And thanks mainly to our local leaders and the people in our communities who finally saw the light and exorcised themselves of the influence of the terrorist NPA. The civilian-led program Peace 911 won the hearts of the people of Paquibato through projects and programs that offered them the opportunity to become productive, provided them with livelihood, made them discover new skills, capacitated women, and built their confidence as individuals and as a community. Peace 911 is an empowering tool. An education tool. This allowed the people of Paquibato to unmask their enemies. Peace 911 ushered in the development of Paquibato while addressing the fundamental issue of poverty. Lest we forget, this terrorist group leeches on the people’s condition of poverty, feeding on their misery as they advance their violent causes. Nakabalo kita nga ang masa, ang mga katawhan, sila ang sandigan ug ginasaligan sa mga teroristang NPA. Ug kung moingon ang masa nga tama na, undangon na nato kini, gikapoy na kami — human na ang away. Sa Davao City, human na ang away. We express our admiration and gratitude to the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, with the help of the Philippine National Police, for successfully ending the insurgency in Davao City. We also remember those who died in the fight to defend us from this terrorist group. Today, we commemorate and celebrate our people’s commitment to the noble principles of freedom and social justice that liberate us from the threats of extremism. Now, we are presented with limitless possibilities for Paquibato and the entire city, taking advantage of the gains of peace to fortify our city and secure the life of the Dabawenyos. Kahibaw ba mo na naay mga adlaw na bisan pa og naa nako sa Department of Education ug sa Office of the Vice President, mag sige lang gihapon ko ug huna-huna sa Paquibato. The peace that we have is fragile, and I realized that sustaining the peace is more difficult than attaining or gaining peace. That is why sige ko og huna-huna kung unsa pa man akong matabang sa Paquibato para ang mga tao makatagamtam dyud og tinuod na kalinaw na wala na’y mag sige ug huna-huna kada gabii kung basig mubalik, basig naa, basig unsa’y mahitabo ugma. Terrorism is a dangerous enemy. The NPA, for one, does not care if you are a member of the military, police, or civilian body. The brutality of this terror group was clearly portrayed by the death of a four-month-old girl in Talakag, Bukidnon, following an NPA ambush in November 2016. I am also reminded of the vendor who died five days after falling into a coma after he was hit by a landmine that the terrorist NPA detonated in Mandug in May 2017. The threat of a terror group like the NPA to the lives of Filipinos, the future of our children, and our most cherished democratic ideals is real. Let us look back at Paquibato when it was still under the shadows of the NPA. Most children were not getting enough nutrition, and many were out of school — a vulnerability exploited by the NPA for recruitment. There was a scarcity of government services and basic infrastructure because Paquibato was an NPA territory — and this made the people's lives more miserable. Kadtong bise mayor pako 2007 up to 2010, kung musaka ka og Paquibato, kailangan pa ka mananghid. Kailangan paka magdala ug sigarilyo alang maghalad didto para ka lang makasaka didto. And only didto lang pud, dili nimo pwede maistorya ang mga tao, mga komunidad tungod kay sila ang nag ampon sa lugar. And as a young public servant at that time, I do not understand why the government allows it to continue. But then again, I said to myself, gipakita ni sa akoa aron mahibaw ko kung unsa akong dapat buhaton, kung unsa akong trabaho as mayor of Davao City. Our anti-insurgency success in Paquibato and the entire Davao City should always remind us that we must dismantle structural factors and tear away the forces that lure our fellow Filipinos, especially our children, into the bosom of our enemies. Filipino parents must have the values and capacity to protect their children from these forces, ensuring that they grow into individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competency needed for them to realize their dreams. Let us guide our children to become catalysts of solidarity, progress, and lasting peace in our respective communities. Naga awhag ko sa atong mga former rebels, sa ilang mga pamilya na paniguraduhon nato na ang atoang mga anak matagamtam nila ang panahon na dili sila maglisod sa ilang pang adlaw-adlaw, ug makab-ot nila ang ilahang mga pangandoy ug gusto buhaton para sa ilang kinabuhi ug para sa ilang pamilya. Education, as we know, harbors power that could change the course of our lives and that of our fellowmen. It is a tool that can emancipate us from poverty or injustice. It is also a powerful tool for peacebuilding and combating terrorism. It is the greatest equalizer. Kay kahibaw man gud mo, kung ang isa ka tao mahuman og, pananglitan ingon nato mahuman siya og nursing, pag graduate nila, wala’y dato ug pobre — pareho mo tanan graduates. Therefore, the opportunities for you will always be the same. Wether or not gikan ka sa dato na pamilya o sa pamilya na nagalisod. The Department of Education is working hard to institutionalize a national peace curriculum to teach our children the value of peace as they build their skills and learn more about conflict resolution and non-violence. Through the national peace curriculum, we strengthen our youth’s resilience, maturity, and sense of patriotism. The prevailing peace in Paquibato is proof that there is hope in our active peacebuilding efforts. Kit-an nako na naa ta’y mga barangay captains diri karon na gikan sa Paquibato. Daghan-daghan pud ang mga barangay captain na namatay tungod sa NPA. Dili nato sila dapat kalimtan ug ang atong trabaho, panihuraduhon nato na ang mga anak nato, mga apo nato na mahimong barangay captain na mamatay tungod sa wala’y hinungdan na rason. Thus, this is a success that must be sustained. And this can only be done if we do not abandon our strength as a community or our shared dreams as a nation. The NPA’s so-called protracted war is ending. The guerrilla warfare tactic is no longer working for them to be able to breathe life into a dying movement. The stench of its doom and imminent demise is repulsive, but something that we anticipate with most profound excitement. Meanwhile, Davao City is just one city. Isa rata sa kadaghan daghan na mga syudad ug munisipyo ang kailangan pang makakat-on sa kung unsa’y naagian nato na kalisod ug kagubot dinhi sa atong syudad ug sa Paquibato District. As we move forward, I hope that one day soon, we wake up to the news that the entire Philippines is already NPA terrorist-free. Let us make this happen. Tanan- para sa Diyos, sa nasud ug sa matag pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
"VPSD Speech for DepEd Language and Inclusion Summit at Marriot Hotel, Pasay City",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-deped-language-and-inclusion-summit-marriot-hotel-pasay-city,2023-05-19,"Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. First, the Department of Education stands with the most profound optimism that we will be able to surmount the challenges that are besetting Philippine basic education. Our confidence is coming from the support of most members of the Senate and Congress to the reforms that we have laid down to resolve learning difficulties. And are also inspired by our partners from the sectors of academe, research centers, non-government organizations, private groups, international agencies, private individuals, and local government units. Some of them are here today. We are joined by some friends from Congress and Senate and other partners — and we wholeheartedly express our gratitude to you. Daghang salamat. This Language and Inclusion Summit underscores our collective task of mainstreaming inclusive education. This brings us to the reality of the complexity of the basic education landscape. We are not only here to ensure the efficient, effective, equitable, and timely delivery of basic education to Filipino children. We are also here to ensure that education is inclusive. That it embraces everyone. That it ends the culture of othering. I believe that basic education only becomes truly meaningful and effective if we can put inclusivity at the center of what we do — if we only make inclusivity the heart and the soul of our reforms and efforts to improve basic education. This means that our MATATAG Agenda does not forget, discriminate against, or disregard Indigenous Peoples or our Lumad brothers and sisters, our Muslim communities, or people with disabilities. Their emancipation from the conditions that have made their lives difficult — compared to other sectors — will only happen through our conscious effort to pull them right into the center of what we do as a community of education stakeholders. Our programs should lift them up, take them away from the sidelines, bail them out from their conditions of hardships and poverty, and ultimately — help them improve their lives. We shall end this culture of othering that is injurious to people outside of our social status or those who belong to the minority or disadvantaged sectors. It is encouraging to see you with us today to address this matter. This is a testament to your dedication and willingness to work with the Department of Education and realize our dreams and aspirations for Filipino learners. We reaffirm our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, and the Education 2030 Framework for Action, which emphasize inclusion and equity as the foundation for quality education. We hope to see our IP or Lumad learners, Muslim learners, and PWD learners experience the same learning experience we provide other learners. We want them to be a part of the school community. When harnessed properly, they bring unique insights, ideas, and perspectives to nation-building programs. We are grateful for the signing into law of Republic Act 11650 in 2022, also known as “Instituting a Policy of Inclusion and Services for Learners with Disabilities in Support of Inclusive Education Act.” The passage of the said law is indeed a milestone for inclusive education in our country. In support of Republic Act 11650, and even years ahead of said legislation, the Department of Education issued and implemented inclusive policies, namely: • DepEd Order No. 23, series of 2022, or the Child Find Policy for Learners with Disabilities Towards Inclusive Education; • DepEd Order No. 045, series of 2021, which tackles the Policy Guidelines on the Selection of and Minimum Requirements for the Conversion of Certain Schools with SPED Centers into Prototype Inclusive Learning Resource Centers; • and DepEd Order No. 29, series of 2018, or the Multi-Factored Assessment Tools for learners identified with red flags. As a result, thirty-two (32) SPED Centers have been converted into Inclusive Learning Resource Centers or ILRCs. However, we are not stopping here because truthfully, these are not enough. DepEd aims to convert and construct more ILRCs and make them functional to provide appropriate intervention to all learners. To operationalize ILRCs, we need a multidisciplinary team to manage and provide appropriate services to learners with disabilities. DepEd has presented to the Department of Budget and Management the need for additional ILRC personnel to fully operate these ILRCs. On the other hand, the Alternative Learning System (ALS), which was institutionalized through Republic Act 11510, improves access to basic education in the underserved and disadvantaged sectors. Through ALS, DepEd can provide opportunities for out-of-school youth and adult learners to develop basic and functional literacy and to access equivalent pathways to complete basic education. As a second-chance education program, it empowers out-of-school youth and adult learners to continue learning in a manner, time, and place suited to their preferences and circumstances. To date, 695,894 learners have been enrolled in the Basic Literacy Program and Accreditation and Equivalency in Elementary and Junior High School Level, while 24,524 ALS Senior High School students have been enrolled in different tracks in selected public schools. The Bureau of Alternative Education continues to produce ALS teaching and learning resources, conducts capacity-building activities for ALS implementers, and establishes ALS Community Learning Centers. In the case of our Madrasah Education Program, we prioritize the integration of Arabic Language and Islamic Values Education (ALIVE) in public madaris or schools and K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum in private madaris. Madrasah emphasizes the study of Arabic, which is the language of the Quran, and a critical component of Islamic studies. Through the study of Arabic, learners develop their language and literacy skills and gain a deeper understanding of the Islamic faith and its teachings. Arabic Language and Islamic Values Education classes emphasize the importance of reading and writing, particularly in Arabic, in which learners learn to read and write Arabic scripts, thus improving their language, literacy, and numeracy skills. The Madrasah Education Program is expected to provide equitable access and opportunities as well as appropriate high-quality basic education programs and services for Muslim learners. The Department of Education continues to provide culture-based education across all grade levels, in partnership with local IP communities, ensuring that national standards and cultural knowledge are learned together for the holistic development of indigenous people’s learners. To ensure the delivery of quality education to Indigenous People, DepEd created the Indigenous Peoples Education Office in 2011. To date, the IP education program, or IPEd, has been implemented in 16 regions and 121 divisions. Currently, over 75 IP languages are being used as the medium of teaching and learning as appropriate, contributing to the increase in IP learners who are now openly embracing their IP identity, as reflected in the DepEd enrollment data. Language and inclusion are closely intertwined. Using a language that a learner can speak or understand promotes a sense of belonging and pride in the latter’s culture, which we believe is critical in ensuring learning motivation and promoting engagement. An inclusive education system recognizes and values the diversity of learners’ backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and languages. Our learners are given access to education in their first language, which they can easily understand. And by the way, when I speak of languages, I also refer to the Filipino Sign Language. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges that children and youth face prejudice on a variety of grounds, including the neglect of their first language. Learners cannot learn what they do not understand. We strongly believe in and promote this in the Department of Education. To avoid further marginalizing learners who are already weak and disadvantaged, educators must make multilingual education a key component of strategic intervention. Marami na tayong nagawa sa larangan ng inclusive education. Subalit malayo pa po ang ating tatahakin. Patuloy nating palalawigin ang ating mga nasimulan sa iba’t ibang inclusive education programs. We have made significant strides to strengthen our inclusion programs, and we vow to continue these efforts until everything is in place for our learners to flourish, so that they have equal opportunities to learn, grow, and be in a positive and non-threatening environment. With the MATATAG Agenda Bansang Makabata and Batang Makabansa in place, I trust that we will not only drumbeat for synchronized efforts of DepEd and external stakeholders to break the barriers in education but more importantly, put a premium on supporting our teachers so that inclusive education can happen in every classroom. I humbly ask our teachers to maintain their fervor in teaching. May you serve our learners in disadvantaged situations with compassion. We reaffirm our MATATAG commitments dedicated to language and inclusion: • To improve English proficiency while recognizing linguistic diversity. We will work towards the goal of English language proficiency within the context of a multilingual nation. • To review the implementation of the Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education Policy guided by the principle that, among others, learners learn when taught in a language that they understand. • To continue with the establishment of Inclusive Learning Resource Centers (ILRCs). • To provide assistive mechanisms such as audio-assisted technology, braille, and large-print test materials to disabled students. We will introduce digital textbooks for certain core subjects in senior high schools. • To work with regional offices and our partners to facilitate the development of learning resources for special needs learners, specifically visually and hearing-impaired learners. • To ensure that all school-age children, youth, and adults in disadvantaged situations participate in inclusive basic learning opportunities and receive appropriate quality education. • To undertake initiatives to provide schooling to many more children and youth in situations of disadvantage, regardless of gender, abilities, psycho-emotional and physical conditions, cultural and religious identity, and socioeconomic standing. • To strengthen our inclusive education programs, including the alternative learning system, last-mile schools, and programs for IP learners, learners with disabilities, and Muslim learners. We will endeavor for all learners, regardless of their backgrounds, to afford quality learning opportunities and services. We will continue to live in our faith that education is a great enabler rather than a great divider. Any noble undertaking, however, cannot succeed if performed single-handedly. Therefore, I appeal to the collective effort of stakeholders to have our sights set on an active call for inclusion. To all of us, let us never dim the lights of inclusive education. Before I end, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Curriculum and Teaching Strand of the Department for making this summit of language and inclusion possible. To the Bureau of Learning Delivery, Bureau of Curriculum Development, Bureau of Learning Resources, Bureau of Education Assessment, Bureau of Alternative Education, and Literacy Coordinating Council thank you for your tireless efforts. Your hard work and dedication are recognized and I am deeply grateful for all that you have been doing. My heartfelt gratitude also goes to all our educators, policymakers, advocates, and stakeholders who have joined us today to participate in this crucial conversation about language and inclusion. Your presence and contributions to this summit demonstrate your commitment to fostering a more equitable and just society in which every learner has the opportunity to thrive and succeed. Mananatili tayong MATATAG tungo sa pagtamo ng ating mga mithiin. Marami pa tayong magagawa dahil patuloy tayong BUONG DANGAL na kikilos para sa kabataang Pilipino. Ang lahat – para sa Diyos, sa Bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for Boy Scouts of the Philippines 66th Annual National Council Meeting (ANCM),https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-boy-scouts-philippines-66th-annual-national-council-meeting-ancm,2023-05-11,"VPSD Speech for Boy Scouts of the Philippines 66th Annual National Council Meeting (ANCM), Leyte Academic Center, Palo, Leyte Event date: May 11, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS & ACKNOWLEDGMENT] Thank you to the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) — the National Executive Board, the Regional Scouting Committee, and the Local Council Executive Board — for inviting me to your 66th Annual Council Meeting. The importance of your organization in the growth and development of young Filipino boys is something that we cannot overemphasize. Over the years, your dedication to the mission to help young Filipino boys become strong, confident, skilled, reliable, responsible, and productive individuals continues to burn. You have been tireless in planting in the hearts and souls of our children the seeds of your organization’s values and principles — guiding their growth, shaping their characters as individuals ever ready to serve others and serve the country — at all times. You have prepared them for bigger men tasks like emergency and disaster preparedness and response — and introduced to them survival skills. The Scout Movement has proven itself as an integral part of our education system — complementing our academic programs for young Filipino boys. This is something that we have been discussing within the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Education — on how to integrate mandatory scouting into the Filipino Peace Culture curriculum. Today, the Marcos administration aggressively implements programs and projects that are aimed at fortifying our strength, our security, and our stability as a nation. Along this is our vision of giving rise to a generation of Filipinos with an enduring love of country — a generation with the willingness and capability to help the government ensure that the Philippines becomes strong, secure, and stable. The values that young Filipino boys learn from the Scout Movement — honesty, integrity, respect, and service to others — are necessary for our pursuit of a strong, secure, and stable nation. May I emphasize that these values are also crucial in realizing the MATATAG Agenda of the Department of Education. The MATATAG Agenda pushes for transformative, concrete, and targeted reforms in our basic education system. It seeks to provide urgent solutions to our troubles and hopes to improve learning among students. Our vision — is for the Philippines to become a Bansang Makabata. And Filipino children to become Batang Makabansa. As our partner, may I call on the Boy Scouts of the Philippines to support our advocacy for all Filipino children to be able to go to school and obtain degrees. Education, as we know it, is a powerful weapon against poverty and a strong shield against forces that aims to manipulate, control, or poison the minds of the Filipino children and youth. Which brings me to my other call for Boy Scouts of the Philippines to help us protect our children from sexual abuses, slavery, the lure of illegal drugs, and the deception of the terrorist Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed terrorist group, New People’s Army, as well as recruitment into extreme religious violent extremism. These forces steal the innocence of our children — crushing their souls and destroying their future, thereby, destroying the future of our country. As a community, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the future of Filipino children. We are also tasked to guarantee that their rights are respected and their welfare is protected. Meanwhile, today, we pay tribute to the Scout Heroes and Scout Leaders who have exhibited the value of commitment, patriotism, and selflessness in their efforts to affect social change in the lives of others, both locally and nationally. These Scout Heroes and Scout Leaders will remind us that we are capable of creating change that could also positively change the lives of others. The National Court of Honor is a wonderful occasion to recognize and celebrate our Scout Leaders and Heroes. May you continue to spread the values of the Scout Movement and inspire children to pursue their dreams and embrace a life of leadership and service, integrity, decency, and love of country. Ang lahat ng ginagawa natin ay para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VP Sara Duterte's Message during the NTF-ELCAC Execom Meeting,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vp-sara-dutertes-message-during-ntf-elcac-execom-meeting,2023-05-10,"VP Sara Duterte's Message during the NTF-ELCAC Execom Meeting Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug maayong hapon kaninyong tanan. Good afternoon to everyone. My heartfelt gratitude to every public servant who are here today to affirm our commitment to ending local communist armed conflict in the Philippines. This is a commitment to bring about peace in our country, especially in the countryside, where our armed enemy feed on the innocence of the people and the condition of poverty that these terrorists perpetuate themselves. This is a show of force — a clear, strong, and powerful statement and warning — against the enemies of the state who slaughter civilians and Indigenous Peoples, abduct and murder and execute members of our security forces, and attempt to pin down our progress as a nation through their ideals anchored on brainwashing, fear, and terrorism. We cannot let these things continue. The so-called protracted war must end. And it must end now. As the Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines, I commend everyone’s dedication to contributing to our country’s fight against the deceptions, injustices, and atrocities perpetrated by the CPP-NPA-NDF. Our love for this country and genuine concern for the welfare of the Filipino People bind us together in this noble mission of protecting the whole nation and securing a better future for the Filipino People. The Education Sector Serving as the Secretary of Education, I have come to realize how deeply ingrained the problem of insurgency in our country is. They have infiltrated our institutions and sectors and remained a serious threat to the well-being of the Filipino People, particularly our youth. Education, therefore, is one of the greatest weapons we can use in suppressing the lies and deceptions of these terrorists and their allied organizations. However, the enemies are also using education as a machine to propagate their violent ideology and systematically recruit Filipino students. We cannot let them continue preying on the innocence and idealistic nature of the Filipino youth. In this regard, the NTF-ELCAC plays a very important role in our endeavors to protect them. Significance of the NTF-ELCAC and EXECOM Meeting We are fortunate that the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict has remained vigilant and proactive in orchestrating responsive measures to repress the State’s enemy for the past five decades. Today’s collaborative exchanges and pronouncements will definitely strengthen our shared efforts to promote good governance as our main strategy to end the communist armed conflict. Our continuing cooperation brings us a step closer to achieving a goal that has eluded us for more than fifty years. But still, we can never afford to be complacent in our efforts despite their diminishing number. Our failure will cause more suffering to the Filipino People – and their victory means the fall of our Nation. Way Forward and Call to Action Our strength lies in the convergence of our efforts towards a common goal of securing peace for our country. EO70 provided us with a platform to bring our efforts together to address the issues that the CTG has been exploiting to advance its agenda. We have already learned that our battle against the CTG takes more than military prowess for us to come out victorious. The whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach proved to be truly effective in this battle against the despicable ways of the CPP-NPA-NDF. We shall take advantage of strength derived from unity and good governance as we promote sustainable peace and development for every Filipino to enjoy. Sama-sama nating buohin ang isang bansang MATATAG: Kabataang Makabansa at Bansang Makabata. Lahat- para sa Diyos, sa bayan at sa pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
"VPSD Speech for Santa Maria, Laguna’s Marilag Festival",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-santa-maria-lagunas-marilag-festival,2023-04-12,"Event Date: April 12, 2023, at 8:00 am Assalamualaikum. Maayong buntag sa inyong tanan. Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat. Nabanggit po ni mayor na marami pong women’s groups dito sa ating Municipality ng Sta. Maria. Noong nakaraang buwan po ay nasa San Pedro, Laguna kami para magbigay ng suporta sa kanilang women’s groups. Noong ako po ay mayor, isa po ‘yan sa mga tinutukan namin dahil unang-una, nakita ko siya sa isang reklamo. Dahil kung ikaw ay mayor, lahat ng tao, lahat ng reklamo, ay pupunta sa iyo. Nakita ko na ang isang babae ay nagrereklamo na kaaway niya ang kanyang kapitbahay na babae rin. Tinawag ko ‘yung aming social worker at tinanong ko sa kanya, “Bakit ang dami-dami nating natatanggap na reklamo na mga magkakapit-bahay na nag-aaway?” Sabi sa akin ng social worker namin na marami kasi sa kanila ang walang ginagawa sa buong araw dahil hinahatid nila ang kanilang mga anak sa paaralan. Pagbalik nila sa bahay ay naglilinis, naglalaba, nagluluto, at pagkatapos ‘nun ay nag to-tong-its habang hinihintay ang kanilang mga anak mula sa paaralan. So doon nagsisimula ang mga away-away dahil wala silang ginagawa. So sinabi ko sa social worker namin na maganda siguro na bigyan natin sila ng alternative sources of income na mayroon silang ginagawa habang naghihintay sila sa kanilang mga anak na makalabas ng paaralan. Kaya gumawa kami ng isang livelihood program na Mag-Negosyo Ta ‘Day at dinala namin ang proyektong iyon sa Office of the Vice President at iyon ang binibigay namin na tulong sa mga women’s groups na napupuntahan at nabibisita namin. Kami po ay nag o-offer ng Php 100,000 na tulong sa mga projects na gustong gawin sa mga organizations. Masaya ako dahil nakabisita ako at naka-attended ng inyong festival at opening program dahil nami-miss ko din po ‘yung mga ganitong mga events. Dahil noong ako ay mayor sa Davao City, marami po kaming mga agri-trade events dahil parehong-pareho po ang Sta. Maria at Davao City — malaki po ang agricultural community namin doon sa Davao City. Nagulat rin ako sa sinabi ni mayor na mayroon rin palang Lanzones dito sa Sta. Maria na tulad ng mga prutas namin sa Davao. Ikinagagalak ko po na makasama kayong muli sa isa na namang importanteng selebrasyon dito sa Laguna — ang Marilag Festival ng bayan ng Santa Maria. Ang inyong bayan ay ipinangalan sa babaeng napakalaki at napakahaga ang papel sa buhay ni Hesus. Marami sa atin ang mga deboto ni Santa Maria at naniniwala sa kanyang kabanalan at pagmamahal sa atin. Masasabi nating, si Santa Maria ay marilag. Nararamdaman natin ang kanyang pagmamahal at pagmamalasakit sa ating buhay. At naniniwala tayo, na ang ating debosyon sa kanya, bilang ina ni Hesus, ay magiging daan para mas mapalapit tayo kay Hesus. Marilag. Ang ibig sabihin — maganda. Ngunit hindi lamang ito nakatuon sa pisikal na kagandahan. Nag-uugat rin ang pagiging marilag sa kabutihan ng puso, at pagkatao. Angkop na angkop ang okasyong ito para magpasalamat tayo sa biyaya ng karilagan ng Santa Maria. Pasalamatan din ninyo ang inyong mga sarili — para sa inyong naging kontribusyon para ang inyong bayan ay maging marilag sa nakalipas na panahon at magpatuloy sa pagiging marilag sa susunod na mga taon. Malaki ang ambag ng Santa Maria sa kaunlaran ng m probinsya ng Laguna. Ang biyaya ng kalikasan sa Santa Maria ay biyaya din sa kalikasan ng inyong probinsya. Bilang food basket ng Laguna Province, malaki ang inyong ginagampanang papel para sa pag-unlad ng inyong mahal na probinsya. And very soon, according to our Mayor, kayo na po ang pinakamalaking supplier ng Kapeng Barako sa buong CALABARZON. Congratulations. Today, we pay tribute as we celebrate the richness of your agricultural farms, the sacrifices and dedication of the people who toil the land, and commitment of everyone behind Santa Maria’s agriculture sector. Allow me to commend the local government and the people of Santa Maria for your resilience and cooperation in paving wider and more sustainable paths of development for your local communities. Experience tells me that the foundations of development and growth that is inclusive — that targets the most vulnerable sectors — are built on good governance. It is my hope that the local leaders of Santa Maria will continue to uphold the values of good governance and become even more relentless in embarking on initiatives for the improved welfare of the communities of Santa Maria. Allow me to commend the local government and the people of Santa Maria for your resilience and cooperation in paving wider and more sustainable paths of development for your local communities. Sa pagkakataong ito, sana ay pahintulutan ninyo ako na manawagan sa lahat ng mga magulang na na nandito ngayon — pati na rin sa lahat ng mga sektor at organisasyon sa Santa Maria. Para po sa kapakanan ng mga kabataan — siguruhin po sana natin na sila ay pumapasok sa paaralan at nag-aaral. Gabayan po natin sila at ipakita natin ang kahalagahan ng edukasyon para sa pagkakaroon ng maayos o magandang buhay. Importante po ang edukasyon para mapagtagumpayan natin ang mga hamon ng buhay at sa ating bayan. Lagi ko pong sinasabi — walang short cut sa tagumpay. Kailangan po ng pagsusumikap ng mga magulang at ng ating kabataan. Noong Enero, inilunsad po ng Department of Education ang Matatag Agenda. The Matatag Agenda highlights the two-track approach of the Department — complementing the traditional solutions of hiring more teachers and building more classrooms with more innovative solutions of tapping modern technology to bridge the gaps in basic education. I also trust at nananawagan po ako sa inyong lahat that you will join our call in combatting local terrorism. Sinisira po ng teroristang grupo na NPA ang buhay at kinabukasan ng ating mga kabataan. Ang NPA ay katulad din po ng kriminal at ilegal na droga. Kailangan rin po natin silang mailayo ang ating mga anak. Magkaisa po tayo dito. Protecting Filipino children is protecting the Philippines. At magkapit-bisig tayo sa paglinang ng marami pang mga paraan para tayo ay umunlad at maisulong ang pagtatayo ng isang maunlad, matibay, at marilag na Pilipinas. I wish you a happy and meaningful Marilag Festival. Lahat - para sa Diyos, bayan, at pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."

"VPSD Speech for the National Election Summit, Sofitel Philippine Plaza",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-national-election-summit-sofitel-philippine-plaza,2023-03-09,"Event Date: March 9, 2023, at 1:00 p.m. Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Before anything else, let me take this opportunity to raise the urgent need for our law enforcement authorities to address, to solve, to put an end to the alarming string of violence perpetrated against elected officials. This spate of violence leaves not only a trail of death but also establishes a chilling climate of fear among the people. Worse, given the experiences of people elected into office, these acts of violence could potentially spawn more bloodbaths if perpetrators and those who masterminded them are not brought to justice. It is not enough that we condemn these attacks. The time calls for prosecution. For the attackers, the killers, and the masterminds to be jailed. May I respectfully and humbly join calls for our law enforcement authorities and other concerned government agencies to exhaust their resources, exert their best efforts, and ensure that no acts of violence will happen again to elected officials, their families, their supporters, and their allies. Dapat po na may managot. Dapat may makulong. Dapat mahinto itong mga ganitong patayan. On that note, I am pleased to join a gathering that seeks ways to safeguard the integrity of our election process in the digital age. This year, as we approach the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections, we are called to demonstrate our commitment to a clean, honest, and meaningful election by improving efficiency and ensuring public confidence in the various stages of the entire electoral process. The presence of every esteemed speaker and stakeholder across different levels of governance in today’s National Election Summit demonstrates our dedication to upholding the Filipinos’ right to vote and harnessing the critical role of technology in promoting responsible voting. Imbued with the spirit of solidarity, we have another opportunity to strengthen the foundation of democracy and sustain our citizen’s trust in the elections. I’m a very young politician. I’ve had five elections in my lifetime. But I always say to my volunteers and supporters na kapag nagsisimula kaming mag strategic plan during my run — huwag mandaya. Kasi there is no honor in cheating and nakakahiya na nagiging mayor ka pero nakukuha mo ‘yun sa pandaraya. Nakakahiya humarap sa mga tao, magalit sa mga tao kapag mayroon silang ginagawang mali or implement the law, and yet, ikaw mismo nakuha mo ‘yung position mo because of pandaraya. There’s nothing honorable about it. May today’s multi-sectorial dialogue enable the formulation of up-to-date reforms and best practices that will fill in electoral gaps and secure the conduct of efficient voting, counting, and canvassing of our people’s votes. I trust that the sanctity of the electoral process will serve as our guidepost as we prepare to ensure transparency and accuracy in our electoral exercise. I welcome the integration of voter’s education in our K-12 program to help prepare and equip our Filipino youth with the ability to discern and engage responsibly in this democratic process. By instituting civic education in youth- and nation-building, we encourage the involvement of an empowered citizenry guided by Filipino values, discernment, and knowledge that are crucial in cultivating a culture of participative democracy. Let us bear in mind that as our Filipino youth cast their vote to elect their immediate community’s leaders, their experience will influence their future political participation and civic engagement. Let us also prioritize avenues for improved technical and legal assistance education among public school teachers as members of the electoral board and as vanguards of the electoral process. I’m sure you’ve heard when I was speaking before the league of municipal mayors, the league of municipalities in the Philippines, I already requested and reminded the politicians not to use the teachers to make them win the elections. Pinaalala ko sa kanila na hindi naman ‘yung teachers ng Department of Education ang makakapagpanalo sa inyo sa election — ‘yung mga ginawa niyo that changed the lives, that implemented a transformative change in your communities — ‘yun yung mga makakapagpanalo sa inyo. Our teachers spend long and tedious hours in polling precincts, often braving threats to their lives and safety. We owe it to them to ensure the safe and credible conduct of vote canvassing. Kanina, I was asking the chairman habang naglalakad kami, “Sino ang participants natin sa summit?” Sabi niya, lahat daw ng stakeholders. Naging masaya ako dahil I am a stakeholder, I am a voter, and I can speak in this summit. Baka naman, sa amin lang from the Department of Education, mauna ‘yung bayad sa mga teachers namin bago ang election. Of course, bumabyahe sila, kumakain sila, and may gastusin din sila during the days na the days na thet are serving the country. Baka lang i-advance, or it can be a consideration, or plan for future elections na mauna ‘yung payments or ‘yung compensation para sa ating mga teachers. At isa pa nga ito sa mga challenges sa ating mga pulis. Ang masiguro ang seguridad ng mga guro na magsisilbi sa panahon ng halalan. Minsan, ang mga guro ay tinatakot ng mga mga warlord politicians at ginagawang kasangkapan sa kanilang pandaraya. Nangyayari ito kadalasan sa mga liblib na lugar at mga lugar na kilalang kontrolado ng mga private armies ng mga pulitiko. Alam natin na mahirap kalaban ang mga warlords na may private army. Pero kailangan nating ipakita na mas mahirap pong kalaban ang mga taong gobyerno katulad ng mga pulis at mga sundalo because they represent the government. Ang mga requests na ito ay naka-address din sa Commission on Elections. In years past, traditional elections, both at the local and national levels, have been tainted with issues on security and safety and raised salient concerns on campaign ethics. During this time of our history, we can benefit from the advantages of digital transformation and secure the gains of increased voter turnout and a deeper appreciation of our people’s right to suffrage. I am optimistic that the reforms you make today will positively impact the course of electioneering by ensuring opportunities for empowerment and accountability. By working together in this undertaking, we can transform our electoral process, promote fair, honest, and safe elections. And above all, pave the way for a well-informed voting public who will elect the rightful leaders of our communities and our nation. Alam niyo, kapag nag school visit ako for the Department of Education, natatanong ko sa mga teachers who serve with the board kung ano ‘yung mga experiences nila sa election as the Department of Education prepares to assist the COMELEC in the coming elections in the coming years. Isa ‘yun sa mga nabanggit ko, ‘yung hirap nila — parang mahirap pa para sa kanila na makuha ang kanilang compensation. But more than that is ‘yung mga actual na pangyayari on the ground. As an example, inuulit-ulit ko kanina, this is true in Mindanao. Kasi nakikita talaga namin, like I say, stakeholder din ako kasi I am a voter. We actually automated the counting, pero manual parin ang pagboboto namin. So sa mga kapitbahay namin doon sa Mindanao, mayroong mga pangyayari na hindi naman talaga na bumoboto ‘yung mga tao dahil pag dating sa school ng mga balota, nakukuha na ‘yun ng mga private armies, and then they do the shadings. That is true in many provinces in Mindanao. So hindi parin lumalabas kung sino ‘yung pinipili ng mga tao doon sa kanilang mga lugar. As you discuss improvements on electoral process and discuss reforms, maybe we can move to something better than shading the ballots or writing on the ballots. Because the technology and biometrics — fingerprints scanning, face scanning, eye scanning, you have all that in your phones. Fingerprint scanning, nakikita niyo na sa iba’t ibang gadgets, ginagamit natin araw-araw. These are things that can improve our process in the elections. Doon sa amin sa Davao, mayroon kaming mga voters who vote in Davao City in the morning, and vote in Western Mindanao in the afternoon — either using the same name, or using a different name, because we don’t have a national database. We cannot see who are the voters, kahit na kapitbatbahay lang namin, Davao del Sur, hindi namin nakikita kung sino ‘yung bumoboto doon na bumoto rin pala sa isang barangay. And that is true. When I was mayor, we have a Task Force Davao checkpoint in all the entrances of Davao City. And kapag mayroonh truck or buses na madaming tao, usually that is a red flag, and naiinform ang mayor. Nasasabihan ang mayor na mayroong pumasok, may isang truck na ganito karami ang tao and they are going to this place. Kapag mayroon ding lumalabas, nasasabihan din ang mayor. Well, I do not know if they are residents of both areas, Davao City and that other area doon sa kabilang side, and then they vote twice. Because sabi nila, “Doon kasi may bilihan. Pag dating mo doon, babayaran ka para bumoto. Dito kasi sa Davao wala kaming nakukuha kaya bumoto lang kami dito kasi kaibigan ka namin, pero pupunta kami doon kasi may pera doon na binibigay sa amin.” That is the reality. That is my experience as city mayor. I am sure it is happening — that is anecdotal, but that is happening in many areas of our country. I am truly happy that there is this summit that is led by the Commission on Election to discuss how we can improve this democratic process so that the will of the people is clear, and the choice of the people is the one who is declared the winner. Kaya malaki rin ang pinagpapasalamat ng Department of Education sa COMELEC para sa discussion na ito dahil nagkaroon kami ng platform para masabi namin kung ano ‘yung mga experiences namin sa pagtulong and serving in the board. And we are very hopeful and optimistic for the commissioners and chairmans on the Commission on Election that there will be an election coming up this year, in the next two years, in the next three years, and the several years to come, na hindi na natin nakikita kung ano ‘yung mga problema na nakikita natin ngayon dahil nabigyan natin ng solusyon dahil mayroon tayong summit na ginagawa where we listen to our stakeholders and we sincely look for solutions to the problems. Ang lahat po ng ginagawa natin – para sa Diyos, sa Bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for the International Women's Day and National Women's Month Philippine Commission on Women,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-international-womens-day-and-national-womens-month-philippine-commission-women,2023-03-08,"Event Date and Time: March 8, 2023, at 9:30 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat. I am truly humbled and honored to be in the presence of Filipinas who are making an incredible impact in the lives of our fellow Filipinas — especially those who have less in life and those who are feeling lost in their battle against discrimination, in their fight for equal rights and opportunities, or in their struggle and suffering from sexual and other forms of abuses committed against women and young girls. I just have something to share with you — a recent experience about being a woman leader, a woman in a high-ranking position. But I have to tell you that I never saw myself by my gender, I never presented myself ever when I campaign, when I go out and talk to people and say na, “Piliin ninyo ako because I am a woman.” I never show myself by my gender. I only see myself as a person, an individual with my unique qualities. In fact, there was an FGD that was conducted for me and it revealed there that people do not vote for me because I am a woman, and more men voted for me than women. Surprisingly, there was an FGD that was conducted for me before I ran as Vice President. When I sit on a stage, enter a room and attend an event, I do not look out if ako lang ba ang babae dito — I do not see it that way. Before I share my thoughts about this gathering's theme, let me say that the work that you do truly inspire many of us to continue our own initiatives to serve, help, and assist other women to become empowered, to become free, and become women who are giving other women the strength, the support, and the reason to pursue a better life for themselves and their loved ones. Kahanga-hanga po ang inyong ginagawa para sa mga kababaihan. At hindi po matatawaran ang epekto ng inyong ginagawa sa mga komunidad. Gaya po ninyo, naniniwala rin ako na kapag ang mga kababaihan sa isang komunidad ay nabigyan ng pagkakataong maging produktibo, kapag sila ay nabigyan ng edukasyon at nagkaroon ng kapangyarihan ng kaalaman, at kapag sila ay nahasa na mamuno, kaya po nilang baguhin ang mukha ng kanilang komunidad. Let me cite as an example in the far-flung community in Davao City called Paquibato District. I’m sure you’ve heard of this. This [area] is the stronghold of the New People’s Army in Davao City for the longest time since the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s until 2016 when I came back as city mayor of Davao City. It has always been impenetrable. It's a community of lumads that gradually deteriorated while it was under the influence of the New People's Army. Most children of Paquibato were uneducated and malnourished growing up. But they had always been prepared to join the underground movement even when they were barely in their teens. Their fathers — if not farmers, could also be members of the armed group. Mostly, the women, their mothers, were the workers while the men were lurking around, ready for a gun battle in case government forces arrived. For generations, the lumads of Paquibato lived in a cycle of violence that robbed them of their right to live peacefully. It was a cycle of violence that also stripped them of many opportunities — education for children, literacy for women, livelihood, and employment for the men. While it is a far-flung village, Paqubato's land is fertile. But because it was controlled by the armed group, there was no development. The roads were craggy, there were no bridges, no schools, no health center, no government presence — just a people isolated from the rest of the world. But we can't allow such an injustice to happen to Paquibato forever. Something happened in the early months when I came back as mayor in Davao City, and that changed my perspective on what to do in Paquibato. I said, “Nakakahiya naman sa mga Dabawenyo. kung magiging mayor ako and Paquibato will be Paquibato in the 1980s and lahat kami dito sa baba, we are in the year 2016. Nakakahiya sa kanila at sa mga Dabawenyo.” Hindi ko gusto na matapos ang term ko as mayor and then they will say na, “Ano ba sa amin ang pagiging mayor mo? Wala namang nagbago sa buhay namin dito.” So I thought I had to make decisive actions in the hope of finding solutions to the root cause of the problems hounding the community for decades. We did an innovation — we introduced Peace 911, a government-initiated but civilian-led peace initiative that required people to help us help themselves. One of the components of the program was to teach lumad women to grow and produce organic vegetables properly. It was something new to them. It required them to become organized. It demanded their time, their attention, their commitment. And it also required them to know what they were doing. The women backyard farmers were taught basic financial literacy and part of the program was to establish a market for their farm products. This did not come without challenges. But we made it happen. Helping us assist the empowerment of women in Paquibato was another empowered woman — a powerhouse of strength, and many of you here may be familiar with her particularly in the work of peace — Ms. Inday Irene Santiago. Her long experience with peace-building in Mindanao and in dealing with people at the grassroots helped us slowly change the landscape of chaos in Paquibato into a landscape of peace. Right before I stepped down as mayor last year in 2022, Davao City, after decades, was considered as an insurgency-free city. I will just have to say na dahil nadaanan namin ‘yun, tinapon namin ang decades-long problem in Paquibato District in 4 years, I think sustaining the peace in the area is more difficult than gaining the peace. Dahil ngayon, pag iniisip ko ang Paquibato, siguro in a snap of fingers, baka bumalik agad ang problema. It’s really very fragile doon. At the forefront of this fight were the women of Paquibato who allowed us to help them. We owe it to them. Apparently, they were tired, exasperated, and fed up with the so-called protracted war waged beguilingly in the name of the Indigenous Peoples. Those women, unlike all of us here, may not have access to advanced technology and innovations. They may not fully understand things about the internet or Facebook or Twitter or how their transistor radio works. But those women — they embraced a version of technology and innovation that was applicable and effective to change their lives and their community. Surely there are many other Paquibatos in the entire country — communities that need technological interventions to address existing structures of violence, including the lack of basic education infrastructures for children and their mothers. I grew up in Mindanao, and naalala ko ‘yung kwento sa giyera sa Maguindanao. Usually natitigil ang klase pag mayroong firefight between the government forces and the rebels. Pag wala na, babalik na ‘yung mga bata. And sometimes, they stay in tents tattered with bullets kasi hindi na useful ang kanilang mga classrooms dahil nasira na ng mga bala at bomba. Nakikita ng mga educators na hindi lang ang mga bata ang nakaupo doon sa mga tents, sumasama rin ang kanilang mga nanay dahil they were deproved of the opportunity to learn and ang maganda doon ay gusto rin nilang matuto kasama ng kanilang mga anak. Today, it is important for us to advocate for an inclusive digital education that will provide opportunities for women and girls to overcome any inequality affecting their development and involvement in the community. I am glad that we have started implementing programs, such as the Innovations for Women Enterprises or iWomen Project which provides technical assistance to women micro-entrepreneurs. We also have the Women-Helping-Women: Innovating Social Enterprises (WHWise) Program that helps prepare women-led social enterprises for growth, scalability, and subsequent venture capital funding. This year, and after this event, I will proceed to Laguna because the Office of the Vice President will implement the Mag Negosyo Ta 'Day program nationwide. It is an entrepreneurship program for women, and then we expanded it to LGBTQI+ members, and other underprivileged sectors. It is my earnest desire that the nationwide roll-out will help stimulate entrepreneurial activities, create employment, and contribute to our post-pandemic recovery. Meanwhile, as we narrow the gender gap to digital accessibility, let us not forget to strengthen our protection mechanisms for Filipinas, including girls, from all kinds of violence committed against them at home, in their workplaces, and in online communities. Ending domestic violence may be insurmountable — but not impossible. The Department of Education is committed to protecting the rights of children in basic education. We have strengthened our Child Protection mechanism and launched the Learner Telesafe Contact Center national hotline where our learners can report cases of abuse including online child sexual exploitation. On this note, allow me to acknowledge the support of our civil society partners who steadfastly provide psychosocial and legal support for victims of child abuse and human trafficking, an abhorrent practice that continues to violate our people's basic human rights and dignity. DepEd is also making sure that teenage mothers who have dropped out of formal school to take care of their children are provided with a second chance to finish basic education and pursue their dreams through the Alternative Learning System or pursue technical skills training through our TESDA programs. Alam niyo, very recently, I visited Pikit National High School in North Cotabato. Pumunta ako doon dahil nawala ang ating mga learners. When I say the data, only 63% are coming to school. I had to go to listen to the interviews with the principal. I told him, “You’re doing it wrong. We understand that the children are in fear and do not wanted to go to school. But that’s not how you do it. You’re at 63%, and you need to be at 100%, so you implement your ADMs or Alternative Delivery Modes, your Blended Learning Programs. You say, we understand that you are afraid to go to school. But you need to continue with your modules at home until you are ready to come to school.” So I had to explain that to them. And since this is a high school, kinausap ko ‘yung mga estudyante. Kasi tinanong ko ‘yung mga principal, “Apart from fear because of the peace and order problems, bakit hindi pumapasok ang mga estudyante?” Sabi niya, “They get pregnant.” I said, “So what did you do?” Sabi niya, “I offered them the open university.” I also talked to the students. Sabi ko, “The best thing for you is abstinence. But in reality, you don’t observe absitinence kasi nangyayari talaga siya.” I also said, “Then what did you do when you’re sexually active?” So I had to tell them that when you are sexually active, you need to go to a health worker and you need to go to a doctor. Ask that doctor what should you do if you’re sexually active.” These are 15, 16 years olds. And they are the age that are likely to get pregnant. I said, “Then what would you do?” There was one person who was brave enough to answer, “Muhunong ko ug skwela (I will stop my studies.” I said, “No. You shouldn’t stop going to school. You should ask your principal on what can they do to help you because you wanted to continue with your studies.” “That is just anecdote. But I think that is the phase of our teenagers right now. So we make sure that they can enroll in ALS, they can enroll in open university, and they can do ADMs — the alternative delivery modes which is the blended learning programs which is one of the learnings that we had from the Covid-19 pandemic. The Marcos administration's Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028 is clear in its commitment to increase social protection programs and strengthen the implementation of laws protecting women in low-income households. Let me emphasize that the pursuit of gender equality is not solely a women's issue. Filipino men are encouraged and have been advocating for gender equality, too. By helping women access economic opportunities, for example, we empower them to be financially independent, improve the standard of living of their families, and are better able to ensure the good health and education of their children. It is my hope that by working hand in hand with this pursuit, we can provide more digital opportunities for socio-economic growth and gender empowerment and thereby enable women to rise above any form of online violence affecting their mental and physical well-being. Let us stand together in our common aspirations for inclusive development and remain at the forefront of social transformation for the benefit of women, children, youth, and other vulnerable groups. Today, may we honor Filipino women and Filipino women who tirelessly and selflessly serve their fellow men and country. In terms of helping women, I just need to highlight the work of my mother who is practically raising my children so I can do more in my work, and I can be with you here this morning. A happy National Women's Day to all of us. Ang lahat ng ating ginagawa – para sa Diyos, sa Bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."

Induction of New Club Members and Creation of Lady Eagles Club of Davao Prime Builders Tagatugon Eagles Club of Davao Region VII Event date: February 24, 2022 at 4:00 pm Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] My warmest greetings to all members of the Fraternal Order of Eagles - Philippine Eagles, Inc. who are here today… And thank you, Davao Prime Builders Tagatugon Eagles Club, for making me part of the Induction of the New Club Members and the Creation of Lady Eagles Club of Davao Prime Builders Tagatugon Eagles Club of Davao Region VII. From the founding of your fraternity, you have continued to uphold the principle of strong sense of family and community through service. Without a doubt, one of your greatest assets is the number of fraternal ties and commitments you have deeply and meaningfully implanted in our communities. And this is true. Usually, ang mga satellite offices sa Office of the Vice President kung nanginahanglan mi ug force multipliers, og manginahanglan mi og assistance, ang amoang mga ginatawag mao ang mga members sa Eagle’s Club para mutabang sa amoa especially when we need to bring response and relief kung naay emergencies and calamities. These have brought you and our fellow Filipinos together. These helped you work toward a shared objective of strengthening relationships among Filipinos and fostering a sense of family and community. Over the years, your organization has gained recognition for its commitment to developing the leadership skills of your members, providing networking opportunities, and engaging your members with philanthropic works that bring about social change. Your acts of kindness have grown into a powerful force for good — spawning optimism and inspiring community members to be productive and better citizens, especially our children and the youth. I am happy to know that the values that you so passionately fostered among yourselves became your refuge throughout the pandemic — when physical isolation challenged or threatened our relationships, connections, and even our mental well-being. Your involvement in several social causes is a testament and a demonstration to your dedication to social change. It’s admirable how you so willingly pooled your resources to respond to certain issues and basic problems besetting underprivileged Filipinos like hunger and child malnutrition, poverty alleviation, homelessness, disaster preparedness and resiliency, and even peace and order. If you are thinking about how to help in some more, the Department of Education is looking for partners sa atoang school-based feeding program because the budget that we have right now nga gi-approved is for just 120 days but sa atoang balaod sa school-based feeding program, we need to do it 220 days or for the entire school year nga nagasulod ang bata sa eskwelahan. I appreciate that you stick to your ideals and continue to support causes that promote government objectives like advancing education, addressing poverty, helping veterans, or tackling social concerns, and promoting peace and security. May your new club members build on the legacy that the Fraternal Order of Eagles has established in our nation. In addition to providing humanitarian aid, I hope you give your members’ ongoing chances for leadership development. Once again, my warm welcome to your new members and offer my biggest congratulations on the Lady Eagles Club of Davao Prime Builders Tagatugon Eagles Club of Davao Region VII's successful establishment. It takes commitment, effort, and a devotion to meet the requirements of the club and its members to be an Eagle. The club will be under your direction, and it is your responsibility to make sure it runs well. I urge you to embrace your duties with excitement and readiness to pick up new skills. I enjoin you to guide the Eagles to greater heights. Together let us work to make Filipino communities more prosperous, united and resilient against future shocks and disruptions. United by your bonds of family and community, you have the power to support the Marcos administration's 8-point socio-economic agenda by promoting economic development and job creation, encourage civic engagement and community service, and promote social and economic inclusion. *I’d just like to echo what our President said, moapil ta sa Eagle’s Club para mutabang sa atoang mga isig ka tawo dili para sa atoang connections atoang mga Kuya ug Ate. I wish you all the best in your new roles, and I look forward to seeing the great things you will accomplish together. Ang lahat ng ating ginagawa ay para sa Diyos, bayan, at pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
2023 League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) General Assembly,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/2023-league-municipalities-philippines-lmp-general-assembly,2023-02-21,"Speech of Vice President Sara Duterte 2023 League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) General Assembly February 21, 2023 Maayong hapon. Magandang hapon sa inyong lahat. I am happy to join friends and former colleagues in local governance in today’s League of Municipalities of the Philippines’ General Assembly. Let me welcome all of you and extend my well-wishes as we once again renew our commitment to building a proactive local government that embodies inclusive and accountable governance. As a former mayor, I am aware of the amount of responsibility that comes with the opportunity to lead and direct our localities to the path of greater growth and sustainable development. Dagdag pa dyan ang trabaho ng mayor na 24/7. Sa pinakamaliit na bagay at pinaka-malaki na problema, ang mayor ang hahanapin ng taumbayan. We are called to remain effective conduits of socio-political change, economic advancement, and cultural development of the communities we serve. Our collective gains in building avenues for prosperity and contributing to the overall advancement of our nation are the lasting legacies we will leave behind not just as local leaders but also as drivers of transformative change. Hence, as you endeavor in a series of discussions that underscore the functions enshrined in Executive Order 138, may you uphold a productive discourse on the provisions in line with public administration and full devolution transition. May I just insert, on the part of the Department of Education with regard to the devolution and construction of the school buildings. Right now, under the 2024 General Appropriations Act, the provisions are silent with regard to the order in the devolution that only 5th and 6th class municipalities are given budget under the school building program of the Department of Education so that this year, 2023 GAA, this year when we implement, there will be municipalities…that will receive school buildings from DepEd. And of course, there is an additional budget coming from the House of Representatives from our Honorable Congressmen, Honorable Members of the House of Representatives who also come from the 1st to 4th class cities and municipalities. So ang sinasabi lang po namin is that, hindi po kami nalimitahan ngayon sa 5th and 6th class municipalities sa budget namin sa school building program. However, because of maliit na budget na binigay as compared to the need of the entire country with regard to the school building program, we used a system-based approach in selecting who will receive budget for school buildings, what municipalities and cities will receive the budget for school building. And we adhere to the needs-based checklist that we came up with that is used by the Department of Education to prioritise the Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas and the Last-Mile Schools of the Department of Education. However, that checklist does not apply to the school building program that were identified by the members of the House of Representatives. Our sustained and concerted efforts in this pursuit will serve as the foundation of policies and strategies that will hopefully augment the services, resources, and facilities devolved from the national government to the local government units. I urge our municipal mayors to remain dedicated to building the capabilities of your respective municipalities as we endeavor toward the path of local autonomy and greater resiliency. Together with representatives from relevant national government agencies, I am optimistic that you will steadfastly work with other local chief executives in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao in tackling salient concerns faced by LGUs across the areas of peace and order, public health, environmental protection, and local tourism among others. May I just share my experience as city mayor, hindi po ako ang pinakamagaling o expert as a city mayor pero meron din akong nine years na naging city mayor and one of the strengths of Davao City during my administration was tourism and peace and order. Unang-una po sa turismo, kailangan nyo po ng pag-aaral. Hindi po pwede na kung ano yung gusto ninyo na maging tourism program ng inyong lugar ay pwede na syang i-rollout. Kailangan po muna ay gumawa kayo ng feasibility study para po kailangan nyo ng budget para sa pag-aaral, para po makikita ninyo kung anong ano ang strengths ng inyong lugar. Sa amin po sa Davao City dahil wala naman kaming magagandang dagat na gustong puntahan ng karamihan, nagtutok po kami sa MICE market o yung Meetings, Incentive, Travels, Conventions and Exhibit and napakahalaga po ang part kapag nakita nyo na po kung ano yung strength ng inyong lugar as a municipality na pwede ninyo pag-invest-an ng inyong tourism budget, ay kailangan nyo po ang partnership at napakahalaga po nito, ang partnership ninyo with the private sector dahil nasa kanila ang pera. Kailangan nyo po ng mga ancillary services na kasama ng paglabas nila sa airport at pagbalik nila sa airport — lahat yun kailangan ninyo ang tulong ng private sector ng lugar ninyo. Pangatlo po, unang-una sinabi ko kanina yung strength ninyo, pangalawa yung partnership ninyo with the private sector, at pangatlo po ay ang plan ninyo — ang short term plan ninyo para sa tourism ninyo at ang long term plan ninyo para sa tourism ninyo. Kapag sinabi po natin na long term, yun po yung mga plano na iniiwan ninyo labas o beyond your term. Sabihin na natin nakabuo ka ng 9 years, kailangan po yung plano ninyo na long term ay umaabot po sa susunod na mayor. Dahil napakahalaga po ng continuity ng mga programa ng isang local government unit para po hindi nasasayang ang inyong mga investments sa inyong tourism program at naiinstitutionalize ninyo ang lahat ng inyong mga ginagawa. By cascading relevant reforms that boost local economic development and promote local governance frameworks, you enable the equitable management of resources and efficient transfer of responsibilities to municipal governments. On this note, let me express my gratitude for your invaluable efforts that led to the successful implementation of our basic education learning recovery plan. Nagpapasalamat po kami sa suporta ng maraming mga local government units na nagroll out ng kanilang mga reading programs, math and science programs nila para sa kanilang mga learners. The Department of Education’s gargantuan task of shepherding 28 million learners back to school in August last year would not have been possible without the support of our local chief executives. While our President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. has committed to increase investments in education in the next six years, let me take this opportunity to enjoin our mayors to convene your local school board and evaluate the need of your local schools. Our schools in GIDA are in dire need of support and we ask you to look into each school kung ano pa pong pwedeng matulong ng mga local government unit ninyo at ng special education fund. An investment in education secures the future peace and progress of your locality. Following the Marcos administration’s 8-point socio-economic agenda on food security, improved transportation, affordable and clean energy, health care, education, social services, sound fiscal management, and bureaucratic efficiency, we have an opportunity to steer our nation to a wider path of socio-economic development that will redound to the advancement of every locality in the country. I enjoin you to work with us in reinvigorating our local government’s ability to shape a sustainable future and sustain the strides we are making in our shared aspirations for inclusive and resilient national growth. Again, my most heartfelt thanks to the LMP for advancing the objectives of decentralization in governance through transparency and professionalism in local leadership. As you assume larger roles in local administration, I trust that you will exemplify greater responsibility in upholding a competent government that will serve the welfare and best interest of the municipalities you selflessly serve. Let me insert here our order for our teachers, for principals, our division superintendents, kasama na po sa mga ARDs namin at sa mga Regional Directors namin sa Department of Education to be professional in their work. Dito po kami nakikiusap sa ating mga kaibigan na mga local chief executives na kailangan po namin na iexplain sa inyo na ang kalidad ng edukasyon ay mayroon pong connection sa kalidad ng teachers na hina-hire ng Department of Education. Unang-una po kapag hindi natin sinusunod ang ranking ng ating mga teachers dahil po merong pinipili ang ating mga politicians at pine-pursue natin sa sa loob ng Department of Education, hindi po natin talaga mababago ang kalidad ng edukasyon ng ating bayan. Kaya po kami ay nakikiusap na sundin po natin ang ranking sa ating pagpili sa mga teachers at hindi po dapat nating pinipilit kung sino yung kakilala, kaibigan, kamag-anak natin sa pagpapasok o hiring ng ating mga teachers sa Department of Education. Pangalawa po ay meron po kaming paulit-ulit na reminder sa aming mga teachers, principals, superintendents, regional directors, assistant regional directors na maging professional po sa kanilang trabaho at wag po pumanig sa kahit sino man politicians. On this point, I’d like to remind our elected public officials, na hindi po ang ating mga teachers, and ating mga principals ang makakapagpanalo sa inyo sa eleksyon. Ang makakapagpanalo po sa inyo sa eleksyon ay ang trabaho ninyo at ang sinseridad ninyo na maipakita sa taumbayan ng inyong mga munisipalidad na gusto nyo ng pagbabago o transformative change in your respective localities — yan po ang magpapanalo sa inyo sa susunod na eleksyon. Let us remain true to the call of public service, foster lasting progress within our communities, and carry on with the crucial task of nation-building with the utmost integrity and democratic accountability. Isisingit ko po dito yung pakikiusap namin sa ating mga local chief executives na kung pwede ay wag po nating gamitin ang ating mga paaralan at ang ating mga teachers sa ating mga aktibidad ng ating mga local government unit. Ang atin pong mga teachers ay paulit-ulit naming nireremind na kailangang sila ay nagtuturo at hindi sila gumagawa ng iba pang bagay lalong-lalo na sa labas po ng ating mga paaralan. And as an end note, I’d like to request everyone to say a personal prayer for the recent violence against elected public officials and local chief executives na sana po ay magawan ng paraan ng ating mga local chief executives sa inyo pong mga municipal peace and order council, city peace and order council, at mga regional peace and order councils ang pagpapanatili ng peace and order sa inyong mga territory. Lahat – para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for Mindanao Development Authority (MinDa) 13th Founding Anniversary,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-mindanao-development-authority-minda-13th-founding-anniversary,2023-02-16,"VPSD Speech for Mindanao Development Authority (MinDa) 13th Founding Anniversary, Acacia Hotel, Davao City Event Date and Time: February 16, 2023, from 3:50 to 5:00 pm Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw ug mayong hapon sa inyong tanan. Congratulations to the Mindanao Development Authority on your 13th Founding Anniversary. I am truly proud and honored to be part of this milestone as you celebrate the socio-economic gains of your mission. And it’s a mission that meant putting Mindanao in the forefront — to accelerate our inclusive progress and facilitate sub-regional economic cooperation with our neighbors in the Southeast Asian region. I said I am proud and honored to be part of this milestone. And this comes from a place called home. I am proud and honored because I am a Dabawenya. And because I am a Mindanawon. For all that it represents, for all that it has accomplished over the past 13 years, and for all that it has built, it is building, and will be building in the coming years — MinDa has constantly stayed the course. And I believe we owe it to those who fought long and hard for the national government to make Mindanao a national agenda. MinDa, as an institution, is an acknowledgment that Mindanao is more than a stage for deadly wars, a breeding ground for terrorist groups, a place where bombs explode and kill hapless civilians, an island of discontent, rebellion, and constant power outages despite being a host to hydropower plants. That we are lagging behind while the rest of the country is seeing accelerated development and growth is already history. It’s a tale of the past — and although true, it’s a tale that should be assigned into our collective memory as a nation. Instead, we should look at MinDA and celebrate all the 13 years that the institution and its outstanding, dedicated, and hardworking people gloriously devoted to changing the landscape of Mindanao. I feel that providing a space, a table, in the Office of the Vice President is not enough to support the Mindanao Development Authority. I always said that if there are big ticket projects coming from Mindanao, from across the regions, I always remind them to let us know — the Office of the Vice President — so that we can help push the agenda, the projects on the national stage. For the past 13 years, MinDa has remained consistent with its holistic and integrated approach to achieving a culturally diverse and progressive region. MinDa inherited this from its mother — the Mindanao Economic Development Council or MEDCo — established in 1992. Just like MEDCO, its mother, MinDa is a witness to how the people of Mindanao had to live in constant fear, bloodshed, displacement, and instability because of armed conflicts, rebellion, and terror attacks. And just like its mother, MinDa and the people behind it strongly, and maybe stubbornly, held their ground, persistent, and resolute to build Mindanao as an island of peace and an island with immense potential for growth and development. There were times when bombs were exploding in some parts of Mindanao and communities have turned into ghost towns — and yet, MEDCO people, and then later, MinDa people, were talking nonstop about Mindanao being an investment hub for the BIMP EAGA Region. Mindanao. Investment hub. It has become their mantra, and it should become our mantra as Mindanawons. And of course, thirteen years after President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9996 in 2010 mandating the creation of the Mindanao Development Authority, we could say that we have made it, that Mindanao made it, that Mindanawons have made it. Today, we celebrate having a reliable agency responsible for promoting inclusive socio-economic growth through the participation of our partners in the private sector and civil society. Over the years, you have fostered equitable development efforts and demonstrated our shared ideals of good governance and strong leadership. This opened the gateways for sustainable peace and advancement of the people of the island. MinDa has successfully placed Mindanao on the map of commerce, of business, of trade, of development. It forged partnerships with various groups and sectors within the BIMP-EAGA region — with Mindanao as its prized asset. You were instrumental in the sustained partnerships between Mindanao and its ASEAN neighbors through collaborations with various foreign chambers, trade and agricultural attachés, and counterpart investment promotion offices within BIMP-EAGA and ASEAN. In war-affected parts of Mindanao, MinDa has devoted its energy to programs and projects across the areas of infrastructure development, peacebuilding, and research and development in partnership with higher education institutions. It is truly laudable — the way MinDa serves as the government’s arm in extending comprehensive development plans and investment programs that drive Mindanao’s rural and urban development. Your recent initiative to gather stakeholders to strengthen urban water systems for enhanced disaster resilience in Mindanao is truly commendable. This is an important step in ensuring better water management programs for the benefit of our local communities. I am also pleased to know that you have successfully forged a wider network of public and private sector partnerships toward improved mitigation measures for flooding within the areas adjacent to the Mindanao River Basin. Your collaboration with local government units, national line agencies, and other civic organizations in strengthening our critical river basins will help Mindanawons prepare for the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, and landslides. I would say, MinDA is an institution that specializes in everything that matters to our lives as Mindanawons not only today but most importantly, in the coming years. On this note, let me enjoin you in our continuing advocacy for youth empowerment through quality academic training and peace education to counter the narratives of violent extremism and terrorism and fight against drug addiction. Let this be our own ‘stubborn’ advocacy and campaign as peace and nation-builders who truly believe in the potential of the Mindanawon youth as catalysts of transformative development in the region. Again, my heartfelt congratulations to the Mindanao Development Authority for marking another productive year of sustainable growth. We have more work to do in our quest for lasting and inclusive development but with your unceasing and impassioned efforts, I am optimistic that we can accelerate Mindanao’s emergence as a powerhouse economy. Let us work together to cultivate a thriving and resilient island region leveraging our cultural and filial connections with BIMP-EAGA and ASEAN neighbors. Lahat po ng ginagawa natin – para sa Diyos, sa bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for Kalinga 28th Founding Anniversary and 4th Bodong Festival,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-kalinga-28th-founding-anniversary-and-4th-bodong-festival,2023-02-13,"Event Date and Time: February 13, 2023 at 10:50 am Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Magandang araw sa lahat. Thank you very much for inviting me to be part of this celebration. It’s a privilege to be here today, to celebrate Kalinga’s 28th Founding Anniversary and 4th Bodong Festival. Kalinga has been fortunate to have a rich, peaceful, and close-knit community. The strength of your foundation is built upon the peaceful co-existence between the six ethnicities and their special fidelity to the local government and the tribal traditions, for which this province is highly recognized. Foremost among these precious traditions is the Bodong, a peace-making system used to forge relationships, resolve conflicts, deliver justice, and preserve peace between communities by preventing violence or retaliation. That this treaty or peace pact remains effective and has been recognized as a viable alternative dispute resolution only means that Kalingas have a deep respect for tribal leaders and elders as well as your cultural traditions. The practice of Bodong in modern times is a testament to how strongly you have preserved your cultural heritage. As such, the Kalingas are the perfect role models for our plan to integrate peace education into our basic education curriculum to teach Filipino children and youth how to resolve conflict peacefully without resorting to violence. The Bodong Festival is therefore a gathering that showcases the inexhaustible strength that the people of Kalinga have been known to possess - the same strength that served as a foundation leading to the recognition of the autonomy of your province 28 years ago. This is a convergence of time that embraces the humble years of independence, paying homage, from the depth of your hearts to the leaders before you who, through their sacrifices and tireless fight against cultural and environmental aggressions, ensured the safety of your province and maintained the charm it possesses. As a visitor, I am filled with enormous awe at seeing the beauty of Kalinga. It is my first time here in Kalinga. It feels like I'm in Davao because in Davao, we hold 11 different indigenous people’s tribes as well. It is mystifying, and I am certain the people who came here and have returned again and again can attest to the comforting vibe of the place and the resonance it brings to those who find refuge in a landscape that remains resplendent and never quiet with its cultural stories. It is a true wonder of our country. Your commitment to hold out strong in the evolution of your heritage, governance, and independence is an important asset- a phenomenal example for others who seek to establish a democratic community despite ethnic diversity and differences. You all live in a much-treasured land, similar like Mindanao, harmoniously managing the use of your beautiful rice terraces and the bristling Chico River — this precious inheritance that enables you to uphold the ancient orientation to agriculture, promote artisan livelihoods, and other methods that can only be found here, in Kalinga. I am proud of the uniqueness of your province, and more so of the strength of its people to preserve it, and the loyalty of your leaders who affirm your collective aspirations. You have so much respect for the sacredness of the environment and maintaining this moral value is a noble accomplishment. As we start implementing Executive Order 138 empowering our local government units toward full autonomy and greater resiliency, I enjoin our local leaders to prioritize investments in education. It has always been said that education is the greatest equalizer. Sa edukasyon po, walang mahirap, walang mayaman — lahat po sila ay graduates. In my Basic Education report last month, I underscored the lack of school infrastructure and resources to support the ideal teaching process as the most pressing issue pounding the Philippine basic education. There is a need to build, repair, and maintain school infrastructures to accommodate the growing number of learners all over the Philippines. Today, let me take this opportunity to reiterate the urgency of appropriate action and collaboration between the Department of Education stakeholders from the local government units, the private sector, and international partners. Right now, in the Department of Education, we are consuming two tracks — to solve the problems of DepEd. One is the traditional track that we do — build our classrooms, hire more teachers, and the other is the institutionalization of the blended-learning program leveraging of the technology that is already available worldwide. I also enjoin you to fight against insurgency and drug addiction that continue to endanger the life and future of our Filipino youth. Let us stand guard against the recruitment of our highly impressionable youth by keeping them in school. Our peace education program will help students disengage from extreme ideals and behaviors and ultimately build resilience against terror and resist the lure of drugs. We may be welcoming the unprecedented transition into the digital age, adjusting to the new normal post-pandemic, fighting against insurgency and drug addiction or pressed by climate change and natural disasters, but I am confident that you will always come forward to rebuild Kalinga as one of the country's most admired treasures. The resilience of Kalinga is inherent to the hands whose skills have been molded by history. And as children of yesteryears, you are now the parents and the leaders responsible to maintain the dignified stature of your homeland and to lay the same foundation for your children's success and of the future generation. Noong ako po ay mayor, lagi ko pong pinapaalala sa mga barangay kung saan po ang aming mga Indigenous People’s Tribe na kahit na ang mga magulang ay mayroong inter-marriage o ang pag-aasawa ng bisaya at ng IP, dapat natuturua na rin nila ang kanilang mga anak kung ano ang kultura ng pagiging miyembro ng Indigenous People’s. I support your efforts to continuously elevate the sanctity of your province. I am behind you in your next pursuit of economic transformations. And I am one with your local leaders in the collective efforts of improving the lives and welfare of your people. Magbigay lang po ako ng karagdagang updates sa ating teachers kung ano ‘yung ginagawa namin sa ating Department of Education Central Office. Unang-una po ay nire-review namin ang Magna Carta for Public School Teachers at patuloy ang pakikipag-usap namin sa mga members ng House of Representatives at Senate kung paano mau-update ang ating batas sa Magna Carta for Public School teachers. Pangalawa po, ang patuloy namin na pakikipag-usap sa Department of Health sa panawagan ng ating mga guro sa libreng medical check-up. Pangatlo po, ay ang pakikipag-usap namin sa GSIS. Ina-acknowledge po nila ang lahat ng demands namin at sinasabihan namin sila na dapat po buwan-buwan ay mayroon kaming coordination meeting hanggang sa maayos namin ang mga accounts ng ating mga teaching and non-teaching personnel sa Department of Education. Ang pang-apat po, ay mayroon po kaming kinakausap na mga grupo ng mga abugado na kung pwede ay tulungan nila kami na mabigyan ng free legal advise ang ating mga guro bago sila pumirma ng kontrata ng loan obligation o utang. Dahil napakahalaga po na maintindihan ninyo kung ano ang pinipirmahan ninyong kontrata, at ma-explain sa inyo ng isang abugado kung ano po ang mangyayari kapag kayo po ay in default sa inyong pagbabayad sa inyong loan obligations. Kaya po kami, nakipag-usap at naghahanap ng partners para po nationwide, ay mayroon mapupuntahan ang ating mga guro para makapagpakonsulta sila kung ano ba ‘yung pinipirmahan nila. ’Yan po ang mga updates namin sa Central Office sa mga ginagawa namin para sa pagtulong sa ating mga teachers sa paulit-ulit nilang problemang hinaharap, hindi lamang sa pagtutuo kundi sa personal nila na mga buhay. Uulitin ko po, napakalaking honor ko na makasama ko kayo at maimbitahan sa inyong celebration. Know that you will always have a friend in the Office of the Vice President. Lahat po ng ginagawa natin, para sa Diyos, sa Bayan at para sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
Welcome Speech for the Opening Ceremony of the 52ND SEAMEO Council Conference,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/welcome-speech-opening-ceremony-52nd-seameo-council-conference,2023-02-08,"February 8, 2023 Assalamualaikum. Ambassadors and Heads of Mission of the SEAMEO Member Countries in the Philippines SEAMEO Council President, Mr. Chan Chun Sing, Minister of Education, Singapore Education Ministers, Deputy Ministers, and Heads of Delegation of the SEAMEO Member Countries SEAMEO High Officials Representatives of the Associate Member Countries and Affiliate Members Regional Center Directors SEAMEO Council Secretariat Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen Magandang hapon. Good afternoon to everyone. Madayaw! Welcome to the Philippines and welcome to the 52nd Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Council Conference! The last two years have been extremely difficult for all of us, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite all the challenges, we have sustained our alliance with virtual meetings and consultations, until today, when all Member Countries are once again convened in one place, ready and committed to working for the improvement of education quality in the region. The potential of regional cooperation as an avenue to sustainable development and shared prosperity is still ours to take. Southeast Asian countries, through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and SEAMEO, have demonstrated to the world the benefits of working together for the common good. Today’s event is evidence of the region's strength in cooperation and underscores the common objective for which we all toil tirelessly: to sustain our development efforts to enhance the lives of ASEAN citizens through equitable, inclusive, and quality education. The recent global health crisis has unraveled some of the weakest areas of our countries’ education systems. It has worsened education inequality, with younger, vulnerable, and disadvantaged children among the most affected. Data from UNICEF indicates that more than half of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries were unable to read or comprehend a simple story even before the pandemic. In addition, learning poverty, or the inability to read and comprehend a basic text by the age of 10, has gotten worse because of the disruption in schooling and is currently thought to be close to 70 percent. In response to the increased need to address educational inequities throughout the world, the United Nations, through the Transforming Education Summit, created five (5) Thematic Action Tracks guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. In all of these, one thing is clear: WE NEED TO ACT NOW. We cannot afford to waste more time. As education leaders, we cannot allow ASEAN children to miss out on the beauty and benefits of learning and the wonders of being able to use it to positively impact the ASEAN and the world. As education leaders, we have a huge responsibility to bear. The decisions we make today will help determine the quality of life in our countries and the entire ASEAN region, and the ripple effect of these decisions can reverberate for generations to come. The Department of Education in the Philippines will continue to support the strategic partnership between the ASEAN Education Sector and SEAMEO to address two pressing issues—equitable access to education and post- pandemic recovery. We recently launched our MATATAG agenda. “Matatag” is the Filipino word for resilience. This is our commitment to the country, our learners, and our fellow Filipinos as we work towards improving the basic education sector. The MATATAG agenda acts as a roadmap of the department as we develop and prepare initiatives to support the Southeast Asian education sector and the Seven Priority Areas of SEAMEO from 2023 to 2025. Under the MATATAG agenda are four key components: MAking the curriculum relevant to produce job-ready, active, and responsible citizens; TAking steps to accelerate the delivery of basic education facilities and provision of services; TAking good care of learners by promoting learner well-being, inclusive education, and a positive learning environment; and Giving support for teachers to teach better. The Philippine government, under the leadership of our President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., has committed to the MATATAG education agenda and has made a national commitment to increase investments in education. The President has emphasized that we cannot fail our children – we need to help them so they become great. We have also urged all sectors to help us in intensifying efforts to ensure that the education we give our learners will be relevant and responsive to the changing times. In the Philippines, the term “Bayanihan” is used to describe the act of coming together to work for a common goal. As the SEAMEO Council convenes today, I urge everyone to embrace the spirit of “bayanihan,” keeping in mind who is at the heart of the work that we do: our ASEAN learners, and the future leaders of our countries. Like the act of Bayanihan, let us continue to value education as a shared duty. Once again, I warmly welcome all SEAMEO Member Countries, Associate Member Countries, Affiliate Members, Regional Centres, partners, and education stakeholders to the 52nd SEAMEO Council Conference. Shukran. Maraming salamat. Thank you very much."
Basic Education Report 2023 Speech,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/basic-education-report-2023-speech,2023-01-30,"January 30, 2023 His Excellency Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. President of the Republic of the Philippines Ladies and Gentlemen, Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug Maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. Sa bahay, bilang ina, kasama ko pong namumuhay ang apat na uri ng learners: isang kindergarten, isang Grade 4, isang Grade 7, at isang Grade 9. Nakikita ko po ang iba’t ibang uri ng problemang nararanasan nila sa kanilang pag-aaral araw-araw. Sa trabaho, bilang Kalihim ng Department of Education, kasama ko namang namumuhay ang mahigit sa 28 million Filipino learners sa buong bansa. At nakikita ko ang napakaraming problemang hinaharap at binubuno nila sa kanilang pag-aaral araw-araw. Four learners at home. Over 28 millions learners all over the Philippines. These, ladies and gentlemen, make my interest in the future of Philippine education a very personal matter. Filipino learners are NOT academically proficient. Oftentimes, Filipino learners experience emotional abuse and exhaustion. Some Filipino learners suffer from psychological fatigue. And being academically insecure, many of them may fail to meet the standards of the demanding and competitive world. These are caused and triggered by conditions present at home, in our communities, and even in our schools as a result of problems ingrained in our system. This is the truth. Ito po ang katotohanan. Mao kini ang kamatuoran sa dagway sa atong kaugmaon. This is our future. But this is a future that we can change. And that’s why we are here. Let us remember that even in the face of death, Dr. Jose Rizal was the perpetual obstinate patriot as he was courageous and defiant before his firing squad executioners. Let us remember that Gabriela Silang, an Ilocano, was unshaken by the grief of widowhood and continued the revolution even after the death of her husband, Diego Silang. Let us remember that in Bohol, Francisco Dagohoy led the longest revolution in our history. And let us remember that in Mindanao, the successful Moro resistance was fortified by the unity forged between Moro leaders across Mindanao and North Borneo by the great Sultan Kudarat. These are just a handful of Filipinos whose sacrifices changed the course of our history as a people. They are Filipinos who demonstrated the indomitability of our spirit as a people. Our children are the children of heroes. They are the descendants of Dr. Jose Rizal, Gabriela Silang, Francisco Dagohoy, and Sultan Kudarat. Our children are bound for greatness. Yes, it is necessary to emphasize that abilities are important to navigate life successfully. But our children must understand that hardships in life are NOT overcome by the best minds. Hardships in life are overcome by the strongest hearts. Today is an opportunity for us to renew our commitment to our children and their future. Hard work. Hard work. Hard work. And only if we work the hardest will our children fly, soar, fight, and win! This is the Basic Education Report 2023. [School Facilities and Learning Resources] The lack of school infrastructure and resources to support the ideal teaching process is the most pressing issue pounding the Philippine basic education. The Department is not blind to the reality that there is a need to build, repair, and maintain school infrastructures to accommodate the growing number of learners all over the Philippines. Today, there are over 28 million Filipino learners studying in public schools all over the Philippines. Our latest inventory shows we have 327,851 school buildings in the country. Out of these school buildings, only 104,536 are in good condition. Due to various reasons, there are also 100,072 school buildings that need minor repairs; 89,252 require major repairs, and 21,727 are set for condemnation. Our schools are not calamity-proof. Among the significant roadblocks to our education infrastructure program are earthquakes, typhoons, landslides, flooding, and even armed conflicts. In the Visayas alone, a total of 17,263 classrooms damaged by Super typhoon Odette are still subject for repair and replacement. Last year in July, I personally visited Clarin National Highschool in Bohol and in August, the Triana Elementary School in Limasawa Island in Southern Leyte. The destruction left by Super typhoon Odette in these schools were heartbreaking — raising the urgency of an appropriate action and collaboration between DepEd and education stakeholders from the local government units, the private sector, and international partners. In Triana Elementary School, a tent donated by an international aid agency has served as the temporary learning space. We need P9.82 Billion for the repair and replacement of Odette-damaged classrooms in the Visayas. For 2023, the Department has allocated a total of P15.6 Billion for new construction. [Procurement] Our assessment of the Department’s procurement practices showed cracks that, if left unresolved, will harm our vision to providing our learners with quality basic education. These procurement practices also illuminated the concern for transparency and accountability. Our assessment showed that the centralized procurement of DepEd has been hounded by: delays in the submission of technical specifications lack of updated guidelines lack of qualified bidders, and low participation rate of prospective bidders There were successful bidders who failed to deliver on time. And worse, there were successful bidders who failed to make deliveries at all. The procurement practices at the Department of Education had red flags that demanded immediate actions. The creation of a separate strand dedicated entirely on matters of procurement was made to improve procurement in DepEd. This strand is ordered to ensure that the delivery of services is done within the period required by law, following the processes mandated by law. Our intention here is to solve a problem that has permeated within the system and ensure that transparency and accountability are present. [Enrollment and LearnerSchool Data] As we confront the dilemma in school infrastructure and learning resources, we looked at the trends in our enrollment and learner data during the pandemic and now, we are implementing post-pandemic programs and reforms. After a significant decrease in 2020 due to COVID-19-related school closures, enrollment has since started to recover. This year, we welcomed around 28.4 million learners in 44,931 public schools and 12,162 private schools nationwide. But recovery in enrollment is limited only to public schools. We saw the decline of enrollment figures in private schools — and eventually, saw some private schools terminating their operations. From 2020 to 2022, more than 1,600 private schools stopped operations. Currently, the Department of Education is responsible for almost 80 percent of schools nationwide — of which, 79 percent are elementary schools. Evidently, there is a wide disparity between the number of elementary and secondary schools in the country. With such a disparity, inclusivity in education remains to be a concern. Despite gains in bridging gaps, learners from Indigenous People’s communities Geographically-Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas, Muslim youth, learners with disabilities, and out-of-school youth and adults still require the attention of the community. We need to improve their participation rate in basic education. [Curriculum and Employability] The core of Basic Education is the Curriculum. The ongoing review of the K-12 curriculum has revealed: Ø that the Curriculum content is congested; Ø that some prerequisites of identified essential learning competencies are missing or misplaced; and Ø that a significant number of learning competencies cater to high cognitive demands. For Senior High School, our work immersion program has contributed to a high passing rate of 90 percent in the National Certificate assessment administered by TESDA. However, industry partners have expressed concern that the time allotment for work immersion is only for familiarization and not for actual skills acquisition. Today, most Senior High School graduates find the need to pursue higher education in order to find employment. The National Senior High School tracer study conducted by the Bureau of Curriculum Development showed that 83 percent of the respondents pursued higher education while only a little over 10 percent of graduates were employed. The K-12 curriculum promised to produce graduates that are employable. That promise remains a promise. [Teaching] Our teachers. They are the lifeblood of the Department of Education. Without our teachers, our mission to carve a better future for our children will fail. Lagi ko pong sinasabi sa ating mga guro — importante kayo sa pag-unlad ng ating bayan. Kayo ang gumagabay at tumutulong sa ating mga kabataan sa pagpapanday ng kanilang mga pangarap sa buhay at pagsa-katuparan ng mga pangarap na ito. And to empower our learners with the relevant skills and knowledge, we shall focus on upscaling your knowledge and capacities as public servants. The assessment on K-12 Curriculum revealed the weak teaching methods of our teachers in addressing 21st-century skills. Studies done by the Research Center for Teacher Quality, the World Bank, and UNICEF showed that teachers need further support, particularly in explicitly and strategically teaching critical thinking and problem-solving skills. While critical thinking was the most evident in the curriculum, it was also the least taught to students by teachers. Instead, lessons leaned towards conceptual or content-based teaching. And lessons lacked in-depth processing to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving. Finally, there appears to be insufficient knowledge on developing 21stcentury skills, including higher-order thinking skills among learners. This is not the fault of our teachers — whose dedication, integrity, and the commitment to serve Filipino children and the country strengthened our collective effort to achieve our shared dreams for our learners. The sad reality is that the system has failed them. This is a system that burdens them with backbreaking and time-consuming administrative tasks, a system that provides no adequate support and robs them of the opportunity to professionally grow and professionally teach, assist, and guide our learners. Ladies and gentlemen, our teachers must return to our classrooms and they must teach. [Learning Outcomes] Another alarming issue that we must address appropriately and effectively is literacy. The 2018 study results of the Programme for International Students Assessment or PISA are distressing as it is alarming for me as a mother and as Secretary of the Department of Education. The study results showed 81 percent of participating Filipino learners could not deal with basic math problems, 81 percent had trouble understanding texts of moderate length, and 78 percent could not recognize correct explanations for scientific phenomena or draw valid conclusions from given data. We can do better than this. We are better than this. But studies like these are opportunities for us to thoroughly examine our system and the defects that hurt our children’s abilities. The current state of basic education behooves us all to take a courageous stand and calls us to work together with the intention and commitment to resolve the challenges in basic education. We fail and we fail our children. In 2022, guided by its mandate and the renewed hope under the administration of President Marcos Jr., the Department of Education took steps toward education reforms. We brought our learners back to school. On August 22, 2022, DepEd opened its doors to over 28 million learners across the nation. Today, 99.54 percent of our public schools are now implementing 5-day-in-person classes. We implemented the National Learning Recovery Plan to support the efforts of our field offices in addressing learning loss. Our road to recovery has begun with learning remediation and intervention programs. We continue to engage parents and legal guardians in facilitating learning and regularly conduct home visitations and follow-ups. We reskilled and upskilled teachers and school leaders. We have provided various capacity development initiatives to 226,367 teachers and school leaders. 15,331 teachers and school leaders received graduate scholarships. 17,636 were trained in early-grade language literacy. 161,700 teachers completed NEAP-subsidized teaching courses. And 31,700 have undergone the Teacher Induction Program. We started the review of the curriculum. As we speak, the revised Kindergarten to Grade 10 curriculum is being finalized. We have also started the review of the Senior High School curriculum. [EDUCATION AGENDA] We have taken small steps. We need to take more. The Department of Education, under the Marcos administration, guided by the Philippine Constitution, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Sustainable Development Goals, reaffirms our commitment to improving the quality of basic education in the country. We know that the road will be bumpy, but our direction is clear. We know that the challenges are vast but we, Filipinos, are resilient. We will overcome. Tayo po ay magiging MATATAG. Tungo sa isang Bansang Makabata at Batang Makabansa. I present to you our Education Agenda ------ [Play AVP] [After AVP] Sa gitna ng hamon sa edukasyon, tayo po ay magiging MATATAG. First, we will MAke the curriculum relevant to produce competent, job-ready, active, and responsible citizens. We will revise the K to 12 Curriculum to make them more responsive to our aspiration as a nation, to develop lifelong learners who are imbued with 21st-century skills, discipline, and patriotism. We will reduce the number of learning areas in K to 3 from 7 to 5 to focus on foundational skills in literacy and numeracy in the early grades, particularly among disadvantaged students. We will strengthen our literacy and numeracy programs. We will revitalize our Reading, Science and Technology, and Math programs by utilizing the gains of previous programs. The programs will be benchmarked with local and international best practices, consulted with experts, and will be research or evidence-based. We will improve English proficiency while recognizing linguistic diversity. We will work towards the goal of English language proficiency within the context of a multilingual nation. We will review the implementation of the Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education Policy, guided by the basic principle that, among others, learners learn when taught in a language that they understand. We will further intensify the values formation of learners in curriculum and teaching, particularly through the Good Manners and Right Conduct and Values Education in adherence to Republic Act 11476. We will embed the culture of peace in our curriculum to develop learners who are peace builders in communities. We will integrate “peace competencies” such as social awareness responsibility, care for the environment, value for diversity, self-esteem, positive character, resilience, and human security into the various learning areas of the K to 12 Curriculum. We will be transparent with curriculum guides. We will share our draft curriculum guides with interested education stakeholders to help us develop a robust curriculum. We will be transparent about our test scores. We will make our test data available for researchers and analysts to aid us in making evidence-based policy decisions. We will share sample test items with schools and teachers to strengthen the use of assessment to improve the teaching and learning process. We will engage with CHED and TESDA, and various industry partners to address the issue of skills mismatch in our Senior High School Program. And we will need your help. To make our graduates employable, we appeal to the industry, and to employers, to accept our students in work immersions, and hire them when they graduate. Secondly, we will TAke steps to accelerate the delivery of basic education facilities and services. We have recently created the School Infrastructure and Facilities Strand. This strand will be devoted entirely to addressing long-standing issues on educational facilities and infrastructure. We will build more resilient schools and classrooms. For 2023, we have the budget to build around 6,000 classrooms. We commit to closing the remaining gaps in school infrastructure with policies to eliminate corruption, and insulate the allocation of school building funds from politicization. We will establish fully-functional library hubs in our division offices. We will provide schools with electricity. In the next 5 years, we will work towards providing electricity especially in our last-mile schools. We will provide e-classroom packages for teaching and learning. Each package will consist of 46 laptops, 2 charging carts, 2 wireless routers, and 1 smart TV. This will accelerate the integration of ICT in teaching and learning and institutionalize blended learning. We will optimize the use of technology, both online and offline, to ensure that learners have opportunities to learn even in the event of a pandemic or other emergencies. We will digitize our essential processes, including our national assessments. We will launch our National Education Portal or NEP, which will provide a dynamic “one-stop-shop” platform available to all basic education stakeholders, such as teachers, learners, and parents. The NEP will substantially cut down the manual process, reduce transaction costs and eliminate errors due to human intervention. We will strengthen the complementarity between public and private schools through the seamless implementation of the Government Assistance and Subsidies program of the DepEd with the creation of the Voucher Program Management Office. Working with private school organizations, we will also speed up the issuance of the Revised Manual of Regulation for Private Schools. We will work closely with Congress in pushing for the expansion of GASTPE coverage to include kindergarten and elementary learners. For our BARMM brothers, sisters and learners, we will always make ourselves available to provide technical expertise. We will fully support your School Building Program and GASTPE direction. The Department of Education is not without legal problems, but we will cooperate with government agencies for a swift and truthful resolution of these issues. Effective education governance is crucial in accelerating the achievement of education outcomes. Next, we will TAke good care of learners by promoting learner well-being, inclusive education, and a positive learning environment. As part of our National Statement of Commitment in the Transforming Education Summit, the DepEd reaffirms its pledge to ensure that all school age children and youth, and adults in situations of disadvantage are participating in inclusive basic learning opportunities and receiving appropriate quality education. We will undertake initiatives to provide schooling to many more children and youth in situations of disadvantage, regardless of gender, abilities, psycho-emotional and physical conditions, cultural and religious identity, and socio-economic standing. We will strengthen and institutionalize the reintegration program for adolescent mothers, Children at Risk (CAR), and Children in Conflict with the Law (CICL) by developing inclusive models and mechanisms applicable to both formal and non-formal learning. We will continue to strengthen the mechanism in safeguarding our learners against all forms of discrimination and dangers. Our Learners Rights and Protection Office (LRPO) has been acting on the reported cases ranging from all kinds of bullying, many forms of abuse, corporal punishment, discrimination, and child neglect. We will improve our learning environments to encourage support, discourage bullying; strengthen the implementation of child protection policies; make students feel safe and respected; and make them, including our IP learners and those with disabilities, feel that they belong. We commit to seeking out mental wellness experts to form interventions at the school level. We will also ensure that all learners have access to relevant guidance and psycho-social services managed and delivered by mental health professionals. To achieve this, we will work with the Department of Budget and Management to obtain higher salary grades for guidance counselors and propose the creation of additional items that will focus on providing learner support services, including guidance-related services in schools. We will strengthen our inclusive education programs, including the alternative learning system, last mile schools, and programs for IP learners and learners with disabilities. We will endeavor that all learners, no matter what their backgrounds are, will be afforded quality learning opportunities and services. We will continue with the establishment of Inclusive Learning Resource Centers (ILRCs). We will provide assessment assistive mechanisms such as audio-assisted technology, Braille, and large-print test materials to students with disabilities. We will introduce digital textbooks for certain core subjects in Senior High School. We will work with the regional offices and our partners to facilitate the development of learning resources for special needs learners, specifically our visually and hearing-impaired learners. We will work with legislators and local government units through the Literacy Coordinating Council to eradicate illiteracy at the city, municipal, and barangay levels through relevant policy issuances, and community literacy program interventions. We will involve our parents and guardians in the education of our children. Finally, we will Give support to teachers to teach better. Teachers are critical to the success of education. When they are supported, education quality improves. We will continuously provide professional development programs, including graduate degree scholarship programs to teachers focusing on their learning area specialization and graduate certificate programs for nonmajors. We will provide support in terms of innovative, responsive, and inclusive teaching approaches following the Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers (PPST). We will capacitate our teachers and learners in utilizing technology in remote learning to maximize the benefits of digital learning. We will provide training and other learning and development interventions for school leaders, namely the school heads, supervisors, superintendents, and assistant superintendents, so that they can better support our teachers to teach better. We will remove non-teaching tasks and provide administrative officers in schools. We will provide adequate manpower complement in schools, manage teachers' workload, and compensate teachers for unique school challenges. We will fast-track the implementation of the career progression policy, so teachers get more opportunities for promotion. We will strictly implement the Merit Selection Policy so that HR recruitment, selection, and appointment to vacant positions in the DepEd are based on key knowledge, skills, attitudes and desired behaviors, and not due to any form of intervention from other government personnel or similar entities outside of DepEd. Within the year, we aim to make the new Teacher Education Council and Secretariat fully functional and start working on its mandates, including setting minimum requirements for pre-service teacher education programs in the country. We will continuously advocate for additional benefits for our teachers. We will implement the policy on the distribution of teacher workload and payment of teaching overload, as provided in the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers. We have also requested the Department of Budget and Management to expand the coverage for the grant of Special Hardship Allowances. We will work towards addressing issues affecting the net-take-home pay of teachers. We are discussing with the Department of Health for the provision of free annual physical examinations for our teachers. We are also closely coordinating with the GSIS for an improved and superior benefits package for all DepEd personnel. We will resolve issues on teachers’ loans, premium remittances, and other benefits. We have committed to meeting at least once a month until these issues are resolved. Lastly, we are looking to provide free legal assistance facility for teachers on matters concerning loan contracts, obligations, and cases. To our teachers, we recognize your zeal, integrity, commitment, and passion. And yes, we also recognize your sacrifices. We thank you for your sacrifices. Maraming salamat po sa inyong dedikasyon. Hindi po namin kayo pababayaan. [Closing Statement] This is our MATATAG Agenda. This is our roadmap. This is our commitment. Now, please allow me to introduce the team that will see to it that those commitments are met. Please stand as I call your name: Curriculum and Teaching Strand Undersecretary Gina Gonong Assistant Secretary Alma Ruby Torio Assistant Secretary G.H. Ambat Human Resource and Organizational Development Strand Undersecretary Gloria Jumamil-Mercado Operations Strand Undersecretary Revsee Escobedo Assistant Secretary Francis Cesar Bringas Assistant Secretary Dexter Galban School Infrastructure and Facilities Strand Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III Legal and Legislative Affairs Strand Undersecretary Jose Arturo De Castro Assistant Secretary Amanda Marie Nograles Administration Strand Undersecretary Kristian Ablan Assistant Secretary Christopher Lawrence Arnuco Finance Strand Undersecretary Annalyn Sevilla Procurement Strand Undersecretary Gerard Chan Assistant Secretary Omar Alexander Romero Today, DepEd stands before you - heart in hand – humbly seeking your support. Improving access, equity, quality, resiliency and well-being will not happen overnight, nor can it be done by DepEd alone. We need a national commitment and sustained effort from all sectors of the society. Together, we will rally for an improved learning system in the country. Together, we will rally for every Filipino child. Para sa isang MATATAG na Bayan. Para sa ating mahal na Pilipinas. Ang lahat – para sa Diyos, sa Bayan, at sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran."
"VPSD Speech for Davao Regional Medical Center and Resident Physician Association Commencement Ceremony, Tagum City Historical and Cultural Center",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-davao-regional-medical-center-and-resident-physician-association-commencement-ceremony-tagum-city-historical-and-cultural-center,2022-12-21,"Event Date: December 21, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. Assalamualaikum. [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Madayaw. Maayong hapon kaninyong tanan. Let me express my warmest congratulations to the Graduating Resident Physicians of Davao Regional Medical Center. I share the pride and joy of the entire DRMC community, the Resident Physician Association, and your families as you culminate a period of comprehensive study and rigorous residency training in this institution. Your admirable display of perseverance, dedication and determination in pursuit of excellent medical service in Tagum and the rest of Davao de Oro makes you a valuable addition to the profession of medicine. At the height of the Covid 19 pandemic, I somehow had a moment of nostalgia with things like: If I had become a doctor, I’d most certainly be among those who were at the frontline, risking their lives to save others. I thank you for your invitation for the second time and for this opportunity to stand before all of you to thank you for your hardwork during the Covid 19 pandemic. Daghan kaayong salamat on behalf of all the patients and the families that you have helped through Covid 19. And along with our doctors and other medical professionals were local government unit chief executives — like me — on the frontlines, delivering health and basic services to the people, ensuring that they become our partners in curbing the spread of the virus, and keeping people in our communities well informed as we had to contend with fear, confusion, panic, and the misery of losing loved ones due to Covid. We still have the ongoing battle against COVID-19. As we speak, the number of cases in the entire country has gone up, although cases in Region XI, and in Davao de Oro in particular, are not alarming. Time and time again, we need to remind our kababayan to observe the proper wearing of masks, and get their booster shots. And while we were head-to-head with the virus, we also had to vigorously prevent the torrent of misinformation and disinformation. In Davao City, the voice of our health professionals effectively took down the flood of fake news that polluted the minds of our people. Our partnership with health experts from the Department of Health and experts from local private health institutions wielded power against the virus. We hope to see collaborations with you on matters concerning public health and welfare in the future. For example, on addressing malnutrition. The prevalence of stunting or malnutrition among children under five continues to be an issue in Davao region. The Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education have launched programs to combat malnutrition among schoolchildren but stunting and the health of pregnant and lactating mothers require a whole-of-government approach, and not just the government, including our private sectors for our health professionals and local government units. There is also an observed steady rise of infectious diseases such as the recent Cholera outbreak. I urge you to remain persistent in our collective fight against these common enemies that affect the most vulnerable sectors of society. Also recently, the Philippine’s HIV-AIDS report offered us a glimpse of what should be done to strengthen efforts to ensure that our citizens do not get infected with HIV. We need to provide the proper education that will not only help Filipinos deepen their understanding of the issue but also enable them to get involved in the advocacy for the elimination of HIV infection. Data shown by the Department of Health in September this year indicates that Region XI comprises 6 percent of the total populace with newly diagnosed cases of HIV. Pregnant women with HIV in the Davao region make up 3 percent of the total number. In all these, I enjoin you in our crucial task of preserving public health in our region as these threats place several socio-economic consequences that put more women, children, and youth at greater risk. As we begin a new chapter of public service in the year ahead, I trust that you will continue to join us in ensuring wider access to affordable and quality care for your patients and creating more opportunities for medical advancement in Mindanao. On this note, let me also extend my sincere congratulations to the Davao Regional Medical Center and Resident Physician Association on the successful bout of residency of this year’s graduating batch. This milestone is a testament to your unwavering commitment to providing quality and reliable healthcare while remaining true to the call of service amid the present challenges faced by the health sector. Kahibalo mo, magtan-aw ko sa Instagram. I do not know the situation diri sa ato sa Philippines but sa Instagram, I follow young doctors who have become influencers sa social media and usually these are Americans. Taod-taod, naa’y mag post sa ilaha ug “condolence,” “condolence sa pamilya ni…” and “one more resident down.” So apparently, taas kaayo ang suicide rates sa ilahang residents didto sa United States of America. And I’d like to remind you, young doctors, we do not come from the same generation. I come from the 1970s. They say na ang born in the 1990s and 2000s, dili na daw sila anad sa kalisod ug dili na daw sila anad na muagi ug kasakit tungod kay gihatag na sa ilang ginikanan ang tanan para dili na sila makabati ug heartaches because the generation of their parents already went through it. Of course, we do not want our children to go through what we have to go through. But I’d like to remind you young doctors na ang pangarap lang ng iba ay nasa kamay niyo na. Mura na ug gugma ba. Ang gusto nimo, naa sa lain ug wala sa imo. Mao sad na ang naa sa inyo karon — the honor to serve our fellowmen are in your hands. Now, if you’re having a hard time, if you need a break, take all the time that you need for a break but don’t take your life because sayang ang gihatag sa Ginoo na oportunidad sa inyoha na mutabang sa ubang tao. I hope this occasion will further inspire you to champion medical education through competence and compassion even as you continuously serve as our steadfast partner in advocacies promoting our people’s greatest welfare. Again, my sincere congratulations to the new resident physicians of DRMC. I look forward to your continuing growth in your chosen specialties and our fruitful partnership in our shared advocacies for the medical community. This is only the beginning of a lifelong and fulfilling journey in public service. I am pleased to know that we have a dedicated and vigorous new generation of medical specialists who will join us paving more sustainable paths of innovation and growth in the field of medicine. Be assured of your government’s continuing support in our collective mission"
Vice President Duterte's Speech at the Knights of Rizal/ National Rizal Youth Leadership Institute 60th Anniversary,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vice-president-dutertes-speech-knights-rizal-national-rizal-youth-leadership-institute-60th-anniversary,2022-12-15,"Knights of Rizal/ National Rizal Youth Leadership Institute 60th Anniversary Theme: Rizal in Dapitan: Systems Thinking in Action Event Date: December 15, 2022, at Baguio Teachers Camp Assalamualaikum. Magandang umaga. Maayong buntag. Good morning to everyone. Patriotism, social discipline, civic virtues, and love of justice. These were the values espoused by our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. And for these reasons, the Knights of Rizal, a civic and patriotic organization, was recognized by the Republic of the Philippines through Republic Act 646 as a chartered entity and instrument by which we promote and instill the life and wisdom of our national hero among Filipinos. My warmest greetings to the Knights of Rizal and the National Rizal Youth Leadership Institute for the successful commemoration of your 60th Anniversary, with the theme, “Rizal in Dapitan: Systems Thinking in Action.” Marahil naitatanong natin — ano nga ba talaga ang naging buhay ni Rizal noong siya ay ipinatapon sa Dapitan? Marami na rin tayong nabasang mga kwento na nagsasalarawan kung ano ang naging karanasan ni Rizal. And having just survived physical isolation and limited mobility during the pandemic — we can be forgiven for thinking that, just like us, Rizal also suffered tremendous anxiety and other mental health issues while in exile. But despite being exiled in Dapitan, our national hero refused to be defeated. He made sure that his 4-year stay in exile was productive and worthwhile – he was not only a visionary or a writer of stirring stories that inspired people to revolt, but he was also a brilliant systems thinker. When he won in a Spanish lottery, he bought a piece of land where he built his own house, a school, a clinic, and homes for his learners and patients, too. He also created a farm system that allowed the community self-sustainable by producing their crops and earning from regular harvests. From such a simple initiative was born the Association of Dapitan Farmers. In Mindanao, where I grew up, a trip to Dapitan to see Rizal’s house is one of those educational field trips you should never miss. I remember that before stepping into his bahay kubo, we saw the water system he built, which gave villagers safe drinking water and saved them from water-borne diseases. When he learned that the people in his community did not know how to fish despite being blessed with convenient access to the resource-rich municipal waters, he did not only teach them fishing but also taught them that fishing can be a source of livelihood. He valued knowledge and generously took in students to learn from him the basic academic teachings that were otherwise not accessible to the intelligent but marginalized people in his community. In Dapitan, even in isolation, Rizal would continue to liberate the Filipinos. Today, together with the National Rizal Youth Leadership Institute, I commend the Knights of Rizal for gathering Filipino youth leaders and providing them with valuable learning experiences. By rediscovering and appreciating the wisdom and genius of our national hero, we open avenues toward greater civic consciousness and social empowerment. Your organization is key in molding young Filipinos into dynamic nation-builders within their respective communities. At this point, let me give a few words to our youth leaders. Let me thank you for your willingness to immerse yourself in the life and works of Dr. Jose Rizal. I hope that through this activity, you will be inspired to be our ambassadors of goodwill to your fellow youth. Rizal’s scholarly life may be far from your reality now. His appetite for learning may not seem attractive compared to the ease of using Google and the magic of the online world. But I believe every Filipino has a social conscience like Rizal. I hope that having a glimpse of his life in exile empowers you to action. The Philippine government needs partners like the Filipino youth to help us spread the importance of education. We need ambassadors who can influence fellow youth to resist the lure of drug addiction or see through the deceitful rhetoric of recruitment to terrorism and violent extremism. We need friends and classmates who can encourage others to stay in school regardless of life’s challenges. Filipinos who will not allow drug addiction and insurgency to steal the dreams and lives of Filipino youth. I trust that as you finish this learning experience, you will go home to your families, schools, and communities eager to share Rizal’s values - patriotism, social discipline, civic virtues, and love of justice. May Rizal’s love for our country and civic consciousness inspire us to serve our fellow Filipinos. Lahat – para sa Diyos, bayan, at pamilyang Pilipino. Shukran. Maraming Salamat po."
"Speech for National Children’s Day Launch of Learner Rights and Protection Office, Website and Learners TeleSafe Contact Center Helpline",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-national-childrens-day-launch-learner-rights-and-protection-office-website-and-learners-telesafe-contact-center-helpline,2022-11-24,"Assalamualaikum. Maayong hapon. Magandang hapon po sa lahat. Mahalaga ang araw na ito, hindi lang dahil tayo ay nagdiriwang sa pagtatapos ng Buwan ng Kabataan o National Children’s Month kundi dahil ang Department of Education ay may ihahandog na regalo para sa ating kabataan. Ito ang regalo ng pagkakaroon ng ligtas na ispasyo o safe space para sa ating kabataan. Today, we are introducing to you the Learner Rights and Protection Office website and a national hotline that will allow us to receive child protection complaints from learners through landline, e-mail, and messages through our Facebook page. The hotline is called the Learners Telesafe Contact Center Helpline. I was introduced to the Child Protection Unit nung mga unang linggo ko dito sa Department of Education. So I started going around the compound of DepEd Central Office and went up and down the buildings and then I found this little, tiny space doon sa Bonifacio building and may nakalagay doon na Child Protection Unit. And I was happy na nakita ko na mayroon Child Protection Unit dito sa Department of Education because child protection is really close to my heart. I shared to the Child Protection Unit ang experience ko sa City Government of Davao. I learned this in Davao City, and I learned the hard way. Noong pagbalik ko as mayor, we always get deaths of children because of abuse — ginulpi, pinahirapan, and pinatay. I was asking our City Social Welfare and Development Office, “Bakit dumarating tayo pag patay na ang bata? Bakit hindi ninyo alam that there is something happening already in the houses in the community? We found out through our interviews in the communities na karamihan sa atin, hindi tayo nakikialam sa gulo ng kapitbahay natin dahil ayaw din natin magulo iyong ating paninirahan sa pamamahay natin. So what we usually do is we keep quiet, turn a blind eye, turn our heads away, and think as if hindi nangyayari iyon because that is not our problem and is not happening in our house. So ganoon ang nakita namin na culture sa mga communities. The reason why hindi natin nalalaman is hindi natin alam, and hindi natin malalaman kung walang mag susumbong na mayroong nangyayaring ganyan. I told them to create an anonymous way where people can report. I won’t have to tell who I am, I don’t have to tell you my name, I just have to tell you kung anong nangyayari sa bata and anong nangyayari sa bahay na iyan. Then that was very simple, we created a hotline and a jingle. I told our City Information Office to get a vanity number, iyong madaling maaalala na number, and ask someone to make a jingle and play the jingle sa entire syudad. And then we did. And ang pinakaunang natuto sa jingle ay ang mga bata. They learned the hotline, they learned the number through the jingle na kahit saan kami pumupunta o kahit anong event, sabi ko, “Ulitin niyo lang ng ulitin ipatugtog iyong catchy jingle natin.” And so everyone learned the number and the jingle, and we started getting reports. Sa dami ng reports na nakuha namin, we have to establish a rescue na ka-partner ng aming hotline. So our hotline team had to had a rescue, vehicles, and lumaki ng lumaki iyong ginagawa ng City Social Welfare and Development Office namin. That was 2016 and I stepped down in 2022, and after 2 deaths, wala na kaminh deaths in Davao City because of abuse. Napakadali na mag set ng mga ways to solve the problems and challenges kung bakit hindi tayo nakakatulong sa mga bata na nangangailangan ng tulong. So I shared with CPU, sabi ko, “Kaya tayo nagugulat nalang sa balita kasi hindi natin alam. Kailangan natin sila na lumapit sa atin and magsabi kung ano ang problema so that we know how to help and for the child to understand that they are being abused, they are exploited, and they are a victim of violence.” Because a child will not know that it is wrong. If you are four, three, or five years old, and you don’t know of anything else except ginugulpi ka, akala mo tama iyan. For example in sexual abuse, hindi alam ng mga bata what is “wrong touching” and what is “right touching.” Kasi karamihan ng Filipino families, we do not talk about sex, about reproductive health. So if ang bata hindi niya alam which is “wrong touching” and what is “right touching”, akala ng bata ay tama, dagdagan pa ng threat ng abuser, later nalang marerealize ng bata na it happened, and it was wrong. I am happy with what I learned sa CPU. I see that we have a plan and I see that we already started about it. When I assumed my role as the DepEd Secretary in June this year, not only did I have to think of solutions to the problems that had hounded the department for years, but I also had to deal with disturbing and painful stories about learners being victims of sexual abuse. One story involved a government teacher dismissed from the Department for sexually abusing three students in 2018. The dismissal meant the cancellation of his eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and permanent disqualification from government service. Another story was more of an exposé that contained personal accounts of alumni students who admitted going through sexual, physical, and emotional abuse from their teachers and school personnel. Some cases were classic examples of sexual grooming — a predatory activity primarily by adult offenders who use their position, resources, charm, and influence to carry out their plan against a child or another vulnerable adult. Some do not understand my position with regard to professionalism. But truly, if you are a teacher, you have no business drinking alcohol with your students. And if you are a teacher and you are attracted to a student you are drinking with, that is preliminaries to what you want to do to the child. That is why I always remind the teachers whenever I talk to them in the field na may linya iyan because you are person of authority. You are not supposed to be biased in your dealings with student. And going out with your students, drinking with your students and may alak, watching pornography with your students, that blurs the line with you as a figure of authority. Kaya lagi kong sinasabi talaga sa mga teachers na you should be professional dahil you are dispensing service to these students who are your clients, and therefore you have to be unbiased and you have to be a role model to them. We also read a report from the Preda Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to protecting the rights of women and children. Their report revealed that one in every three or four children experience some acts of sexual abuse before they reach eighteen. The report was deeply heartbreaking. It included the case of a 12-year-old girl who was raped by her father in December 2020 and January 2021. The father is now serving three sentences for the rape of his child. In cases of sexual violence, we know that, often, victims would rather suffer in silence and endure the abuse and hope it stops. They would choose to suffer in silence because of fear of being shamed, fear for their security and or the security of their loved ones, or fear of being blamed by other family members for breaking the family. And we, the entire country, the entire Department of Education, want to change this. Upon learning about the alleged abuses of learners by school teachers, I requested the National Bureau of Investigation to conduct a special investigation into the matter. Within DepEd, I requested the Child Protection Unit to submit a report of the total number of reported cases of abuse committed against children from DepEd offices across the country. As of October 2022, DepEd’s Learner Rights and Protection Office recorded 1,871 child abuse cases from 2019 to 2020. But this is only the tip of the iceberg because this data does not include figures from 10 regions that have yet to submit their reports. But I am happy that DepEd, that we, are taking strides in the campaign to end violence and sexual abuse in schools. Sa atin namang mga guro at mga kawani ng DepEd, tulungan natin ang mga batang biktima ng pang-aabuso. At dahil ang mga suspek ay mga katrabaho natin sa gobyerno, mas kailangan ng mga biktima ang ating support. DepEd will ensure a safe and nurturing learning environment by strengthening child protection mechanisms in schools. Just this month, as mentioned earlier, our first batch of our focal persons in the Central Offices, Regional Offices, and Schools Division Offices attended a Child Protection Specialization Course. These Child Protection Specialists will, in turn, capacitate the Child Protection Committee in schools. The presence of this committee in schools will strengthen our learner’s faith in our school’s capacity to protect them. DepEd will also teach our learners to know about safety threats, how to respond to the threats, and to whom they should call or communicate when threats happen. The Learners TeleSafe Contact Center Helpline will also address child abuse victims’ concerns, such as a possible backlash, victim shaming, or harsh physical punishment. Pwede pong tawagan ang helpline sa pamamagitan ng landline at cellphone o i-text. Pwede ring mag-email o magpadala ng message sa Facebook. Moving forward, the Rights and Protection Office intends to launch a podcast, videocast, and other projects and activities, including additional eLearning courses in partnership with the Stairway Foundation Inc., and Child Protection Network. We look forward to working with our education champions, barangay leaders, civil society partners, and fellow child protection advocates to strengthen our Learners TeleSafe Contact Center Helpline, provide immediate assistance to our learner-victims, and bolster our existing intervention mechanism and referral system. Obligasyon po natin na protektahan ang mga kabataan sa mga pang-aabuso at karahasan dahil sila po ang hope of our country. Patuloy natin mahalin ang Pilipinas. Shukran. Maraming salamat."

(PLAI)",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-annual-national-congress-2022-philippine-librarians-association-inc-plai,2022-11-23,"Speech for the Annual National Congress 2022 Philippine Librarians Association, Inc. (PLAI)Iloilo Convention Center | Iloilo City, Philippines Event Date: November 23, 2022 | 9:00 AM Assalamualaikum! [STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUESTS] Maayong buntag. Maayong aga. Good morning to everyone. Congratulations to the Philippine Librarians Association, Inc. (PLAI), the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, and the National Library of the Philippines for the success of your Annual National Congress 2022. I am honored to be invited by one of the oldest library associations in Southeast Asia and the world. Some say that physical books are already a thing of the past and that brick-and-mortar libraries are now relegated to storage areas of ancient knowledge. I beg to disagree. While the digital era has drastically changed our reading habits and decreased our preference for paper-based reading materials, the likelihood of gathering unverified data has also increased. Many of us present in these halls learned to love reading because there were librarians who understood our specific information needs and ushered us into finding the books that we needed. We developed some of our most fundamental socio-emotional skills through reading children’s stories. We became the characters of the books we were reading. We journeyed with them, felt their frustration, their sadness, their grief. We dreamed with them. And down to the last page, we waited for the happy ending. And oftentimes, we triumphed. Noong ako po ay mayor, nanalo po ang Davao City ng Best Library — three times national and one international awardee ang Davao City Library. Mahilig ako magbasa, that is how I learned English dahil ‘yung nanay ko mahilig magbasa at nakuha ko iyon sa nanay ko. Naisip ko one day, kapag merong extra money ang City Government of Davao, I will set it aside in building the proper library na kapag manalo kami, sasabihin na ‘This is the best library in the Philippines right now.’ Kung lagi kong pinagliliban ang building of the Davao City Library for next year and next year, hindi ko ito magagawa. Noong 2016, nabigyan ako ng opportunity na bumalik. Sabi ko sa administration, dahan-dahanin natin. Every year, lagyan natin ng pondo ang pag gawa ng library natin. Naghanap kami ng partner at nakita namin ang PAGCOR. One of their mandates is support to education, so sinabi namin, “please, lahat ng budget for Davao City ay ibigay na natin sa library.” We invested every year sa library and I would like to invite everyone to visit Davao City because this library, our 5-storey library right now, is something that the Philippines can be proud kapag sinabi na this is the best library right now that we have in our country. Merong ngang hindi taga Davao City na lumalapit sa akin at sinasabi nila na napuntahan namin ang library niyo and nagustuhan namin ang mga nakita namin sa library. In fact, ang aming library are very well-thought-of ng mga Bisaya because we wanted to showcase Davao City not only for the information sector, but for tourist attraction for Davao City. We hope that one day, kapag napadaan po kayo sa Davao City o sa mga kapitbahay na mga lugar namin sa Mindanao, ay bumisita po kayo sa Davao City Library para po kapag manalo tayo in international awards, ay magiging proud po tayo as Filipinos that this library in Mindanao, in Davao City, won an international award because it deserves the award. I just want to make a special mention kay Ma’am Bing Alajar. She is the one who inspired me to dream of that library. She made sure that libraries are given enough resources. Our librarians in the Philippines will always have a friend in the Office of the Vice President because I believe in your contribution to our education. Not just to our learners, but even to our adults. Lahat ng residents at lahat ng ating mga kababayan, they deserve libraries everywhere they go and every place they visit. During my recent meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris, one of the many things that we discussed include the challenges that we are facing at the Department of Education — particularly the impact of Covid 19 to the learning progress of our children. I also briefed her about our efforts through the K-12 program to ensure that our senior high school graduates are equipped with the right knowledge and skills that make them employment-ready. But one of the crucial learning losses that the Department of Education wants to remedy is reading. Both parents and teachers play unassailable roles in the success of our campaign to ensure that our learners are able to read and understand what they are reading. Reading books and accessing correct information from proper, dependable, credible sources improves our young learners’ capacity to navigate life’s ups and downs and gives them a greater understanding of what is happening to the world. This experience complements the lessons they get from their basic education, enabling them to be well informed, and in the end, allowing them to make informed choices and right decisions. These informed choices and right life decisions may include resisting the lures of drug abuse or being able to discern the deceitful ways of recruitment of the NPA and terrorists. We do not want our society’s enemies to win over decent, honest, hard-working citizens — our learners, our children. We cannot let them take away our country’s hope and bright future. Just as we do not want fake news, confirmation bias, and conspiracy theories to infiltrate our communities and create false beliefs in our people, especially our children. Every peace-loving Filipino should aggressively help the government in its pursuit to protect Filipino children from drugs, the NPAs, pornography, fake news, disinformation, from recruitment into violent extremism. At malaki syempre ang papel ng mga librarians dito. The goal of developing children reading competency and molding them into productive, responsible, and mentally healthy citizens does not rest on schools and teachers alone. We need a whole-of-society approach to help our children improve their reading proficiency. The Davao City Public Library and Information Center was built on the idea of maintaining a literate and informed society. It has served as a knowledge hub for the Dabawenyos where people from all walks of life can come and go, and speak with respect and nostalgia about how it has responded to the lifestyle changes of the Dabawenyos. The same is true for Iloilo City’s public library. With bigger, more modernized facilities, our public libraries have evolved from a quiet and quaint repository of books into a dynamic destination center continually promoting social cohesion, equal opportunities for personal development and free education, and initiators of public events for local and national development. Alam niyo po sa mga syudad, lagi pong merong competition dahil mayroon pong mga ratings ang ating DTI and DILG sa performance ng mga syudad. And Iloilo City is always the city that Davao City benchmarks our projects and programs because Iloilo City is one of the top performing and most awarded city in the Philippines. By modernizing our libraries we have also elevated the tasks of today’s librarians. Our librarians are no longer just gatekeeping books and other traditional sources of knowledge, they now serve as information managers and knowledge managers using today’s technological advances. It is high time for our public libraries to go beyond the role of lending books. While the quiet and calm environment of a library makes it a haven to develop our creativity, imagination, and independent thinking, we also need to reinvent and extend services to children and youth from low-income families for whom reading books is a luxury. But there is hope. By deploying mobile libraries, children and youth in far-flung communities can access the services of libraries and read books in the comfort of their community centers. With over 7,000 islands, I am glad that many organizations, not just our local government units and the Department of Education have launched their own mobile libraries. There is the Lakbay Alalay in Tarlac, the Library Van Caravan in Ilocos Norte, and the mobile libraries of Davao City, Isabela City in Basilan, and Lanao del Norte. May our librarians be up to the task of supplementing school-based interventions by getting out of their comfort zones to help a new generation of Filipinos learn to love reading. Shukran. Madamo gid nga salamat."
Message for the Annual Kusog Mindanaw Conference 2022 Kusog Mindanaw,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/message-annual-kusog-mindanaw-conference-2022-kusog-mindanaw,2022-11-11,"Assalamualaikum! Maayong buntag sa atong tanan. Magandang araw po sa lahat. Congratulations and daghang salamat to Kusog Mindanaw for spearheading this gathering of peace advocates, ***FORMER COMBATANTS, government officials, private organizations, grassroots representatives, and civil society groups and international organizations supportive of the Mindanao Agenda. Over the years, Kusog Mindanaw and its partners provided the country and the international community with a platform to look at Mindanao from the perspective of the Mindanaoans, highlighting the struggle for recognition of the Moro and Lumad rights over their lands and territories, the longing for peace and the end of wars, or the dream of experiencing meaningful development and progress. I know that many of you here have advocated for the end of the Moro rebellion all your lives — working tirelessly, and fearlessly with leaders of the Moro groups, leaders and members of communities, grassroots organizations, other peace advocacy groups and institutions, and the so-called “Peace Doves”. Peace Doves, I was once told, were top government officials, maybe members of the cabinet, or ranking military officials, who were supportive of the calls for the end of war. And there were War Hawks — also top government officials, maybe members of the cabinet, or ranking military officials, who were exactly the opposite of Peace Doves. Some of you here may have witnessed the signing of the peace agreement between the Moro National Liberation Front and the Philippine government under the leadership of the late President Fidel Ramos in 1996. And some of you have also been there when the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Philippine government under the leadership of the late President Benigno Aquino in 2014. Both presidents are no longer with us, but I believe that some of those who worked with their Peace Doves continue the Mindanao peace advocacy works even today. Mindanao had been considerably quiet for quite a time now. After the signing of the peace agreement between the MILF and the Philippine government in 2014, there have been no major wars in Mindanao. During the time of President Rodrigo Duterte, with the exemption of the foiled siege of Marawi City by supporters of a notorious international terror group, Mindanao has been relatively silent. The incidents of kidnapping by Abu Sayyaf Groups under President Duterte — zero. While we had to deal with radicalized groups behind terror attacks in Mindanao, including the bomb attack that killed civilians in Davao City in 2016…and the intensified military campaign against the New People’s Army, practically, we have seen zero deployments of massive number of soldiers to Mindanao for a government-initiated all-out-war. We have been told that there’s a time for everything. I believe it’s ‘peace harvest season’ for us now in Mindanao. The seeds of peace that you have planted all these years, the seeds of peace watered by the blood of Filipino martyrs who fought against each other, the seeds of peace nurtured by your sacrifices and bravery and that undying fire I see in your eyes — they have grown and their flowers now in bloom. You have all the reasons to be proud of the tremendous job that you have done for Mindanao and your fellow Mindanaoans. After all, as we all know already, it takes many years and many wars and countless lives of armed fighters, soldiers, and civilians — all of them Filipinos — to grow peace, watch it bloom, and celebrate its glory. Peace is a delicate, fragile beauty. It needs constant attention. In the case of Mindanao, it does not only need our continuous attention. It needs our constant, collective attention. If causes of conflicts are left unresolved, a minor clash, perhaps between an armed group and government soldiers perhaps, somewhere in Maguindanao, could quickly escalate into a war that could potentially result in deaths and the displacement of civilians. If ignored, a terror group’s activity, although it might appear harmless on the surface, could explode into something deadly — and may reduce a proud city into decay. Why I am emphasizing Mindanao peace in this conference today because peace in Mindanao remains to be on top of the Mindanao agenda. Mindanao continues to hold so much promise. I know this for a fact being a Mindanawon myself. And Mindanao, my home, our home, will forever be trapped in a miserable state of underdevelopment, and most of its people, living in various conditions of poverty, if we do not protect the gains of peace that you have painstakingly labored for all your lives. Borne, raised, and having moved around many places of Mindanao — reaching former conflict areas and seeing battle scars around — I know that Mindanao has had enough of the madness of wars. It should be a thing of the past, a dark chapter in our history as a people. War in Mindanao should be remembered only to remind us of why we should all work together and commit, protect, and defend peace at all costs. Harvest time — peace time — is a good time for us. It allows the government to address problems that, if not given appropriate attention, could be exploited by terror groups to foment anger and incite people to resist the government, resort to violence and join their cause. Poverty is a mainstay in the playbook of the NPAs in their recruitment of people to join their cause against the government. That’s the reason why we implemented the Peace 911 Program in Paquibato District — with the help of ma’am Irene Santiago — and we succeeded in eliminating the insurgency problem in the area. In my experience in politics, I have realized that the antidote to war is good governance. And good governance breeds public trust. When people see government officials working with integrity, professionalism, and dedication to public service — they no longer see sense in causes that espouse violence. The Mindanao Agenda is a Philippine Agenda. How do we sustain that requires unified action and our collective voice. And only through that that we will be able to keep the flowers of peace in Mindanao forever in bloom. Shukran. Daghant salamat."
Speech of Vice President Sara Duterte for Naval Special Operations Command 66th Founding Anniversary,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-vice-president-sara-duterte-naval-special-operations-command-66th-founding-anniversary,2022-11-04,"Assalamualaikum. Maayong hapon sa tanan. Magandang hapon sa inyong lahat. Daghang salamat…maraming, maraming salamat po sa inyong imbitasyon sa akin para maging tagapagsalita sa inyong selebrasyon ng inyong 66th Founding Anniversary. I am truly honored to be part of a celebration that honors patriotism and those who embody the value of selflessness, the passion to serve their fellow Filipinos, and the respect and undying love of country. Patriotism holds a very special place in my heart. At malaki ang respeto ko sa mga Pilipino na katulad ninyo. Sumasaludo po ako sa inyo at taos-puso po akong nagpapasalamat sa inyong kabayanihan. Alam ninyo, ang isa sa mga pangarap ko ay sana mas maraming kabataang Pilipino ang pumasok sa Philippine Navy o anumang sangay ng Armed Forces of the Philippines o maging sa Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, at Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. Siguro mas mainganyo silang umanib sa Naval Special Operations Command kung makita nila bakit kayo tinaguriang elite force ng Philippine Navy. Naniniwala po kasi ako na kapag napag-alab natin sa puso ng bawat Pilipino ang pagmamahal sa bayan — ang pagiging tunay na makabansa, ang pagiging tunay na makabayan — maitatawid natin ang Pilipinas. Makakaraos tayo. Uunlad tayo. Minsan, may nabasa ako. Ang sabi niya mahirap daw pong mahalin ang Pilipinas. Ang sabi ko, that’s not true. At isa kayo — kayong mga magigiting na kasapi ng Naval Special Operations Command ng Philippine Navy — ang makakapagpatotoo na hindi totoong mahirap mahalin ang Pilipinas. Sa loob ng 66 years, ipinakita ninyo ang magandang halimbawa ng pagmamahal sa bayan. Isa itong uri ng pagmamahal na hindi namamatay sa panahon na nahaharap tayo sa pagsubok. Isa itong pagmamahal na mas nag-aalab at mas umiinit sa tuwing tayo ay nakakaranas ng kahirapan. Isa itong uri ng pagmamahal na hindi nawawala at patuloy na nararamdaman sa hirap at ginhawa man. Again, I am happy to be with you today. I am honored to be in the presence of soldiers from the Philippine Navy whose special training in warfare and security and anti-terrorism have earned them quite a reputation — and that reputation is nothing less than exceptionally good. Kayo daw ang Filipino version ng US Navy Seals. Bihasa kayo sa sa sea, air, land o SEAL operations. In recent years, the Philippines succeeded in several counter-terrorism operations, most prominently against the Abu Sayyaf Group with help from the brave soldiers from the Naval Special Operations Command. In this highly volatile, uncertain, complex world, and the Philippines being an archipelago, the Naval Special Operations Command plays an important role in ensuring the security of the nation. This underscores the importance of continuously training and upgrading the skills and tools of the Naval Special Operations Command soldiers. And I personally support future joint military exercises with other nations to build the capacity of our soldiers and strengthen our defense against threats to our security. We hope to continue to foster greater cooperation and strengthen security ties with other nations as we maintain that the Philippines is a friend to everyone. Now, please allow me to reiterate this. Malaki ang respeto ko sa inyong lahat — katulad ng respeto ko sa lahat ng mga kasapi ng Armed Forces of the Philippines at Philippine National Police at iba pang grupo o indibidwal na nagkakaisa sa layunin na protektahan natin ang bansa at isulong ang katatagan at kaunlaran nito. Ibang klase kayong magmahal sa Pilipinas. Kakambal nito ay sakripisyo. Nagpapasalamat ako sa inyong kabayanihan sa pagsisilbi sa ating bayan at pagpapanatili ng kapayapaan at seguridad ng sambayanang Pilipino. The Philippines and the Filipino people are lucky to experience your patriotism, your love — one that is without condition, one that expects nothing in return, and one that is saddled with so many sacrifices. Congratulations po sa inyo. At sa mga susunod pang mga taon, hangad ko na magpatuloy ang inyong katatagan, katapangan, katapatan, at pagmamahal sa bayan. Mabuhay po kayo. Patuloy po nating mahalin ang Pilipinas. Shukran. Maraming salamat."
Speech of Vice President Sara Duterte for National Library of the Philippines 32nd Library and Information Services Month (LISM) Opening Ceremonies,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-vice-president-sara-duterte-national-library-philippines-32nd-library-and-information-services-month-lism-opening-ceremonies,2022-11-04,"Assalamualaikum. Magandang araw sa lahat. I am very honored to be invited today, and it is my pleasure to help kick off the observation of the 32nd Library and Information Services Month. And may I congratulate the National Library of the Philippines and everyone here today who are representing libraries across our country for the inspiring work you are doing as literacy partners of the Department of Education. While I have seen how some Philippine libraries have evolved through time to keep up with technology and the exchange of information that travels at the speed of light, our libraries have protected the foundations upon which they were built. You have maintained the integrity of libraries as learning hubs for Filipinos — offering the public relevant, verified, reviewed, truthful, and reliable information. And this is not an easy task. Not in this day and age. Today we are virtually swimming through a vast, endless ocean of digital information. And just like an ocean, the information that can be had through digital information is breathtaking as it is abundant. But it is not without dangers. Those waters are often perilous. Like the deep blue sea, the digital world has an ecosystem that — if not managed well, if not utilized well — may confuse the public, steal away the quality and truthful information, contribute to miseducation, and lead them right down its darkest parts. We have seen how accessibility to online information has diluted depth and quality — or how convenience watered down hard work, diligence, and thirst for knowledge. There is an over-reliance on digital platforms as a source of information. This encompasses sectors, gender, age, and class. Ang sabi nila, “i-Google mo lang yan.” And true enough, you only need to go to Google, and all the information you supposedly need would come streaming before you in seconds. You only need to click a link you think is relevant — you feel is relevant but not sure if it is relevant. But that’s not a problem. You can find another link if you are unsure. And then another. The next step is — highlight the text. Press Control plus C to copy. Press Control plus V to paste. And that’s it. Research done. Whether the information was reliable or not is not a guarantee. I find this part of technology worrisome. As a mother of three very young children with access to technology and online information, I am aware of the possibility of them wandering around the dark side of the online world. Meanwhile, at the library, you have to go through a process as ancient as time. At kahit saan ka tumingin, makikita mo ang mga poster na may nakasulat na “silence” — in bold letters. There are sections with computers offering online information, but you are at the library for the books. And sometimes, you may find yourself lost in the middle of a labyrinth of reading materials — literally and figuratively. But lest I will be misunderstood, I am not demonizing technology and digital information. The Department of Education is, in fact, cognizant of its role in improving the learning experience of Filipino children, and we recognize our private partners who are committed to assisting DepEd. And at the height of the pandemic, Filipino learners relied on online education. However, it’s a given that online information can be skewed. It can be incomplete or erroneous. It can be curated and produced to provoke a particular reaction, incite hate, and peddle lies and misinformation. In the case of online education, DepEd maintains that it should only serve as a support to in-person instruction. And this brings me back to the relevance of advocating for the importance of libraries, given that they are founded on the idea of a real community organizing a wealth of information and serving for the personal enrichment of the people. As a repository of knowledge, libraries play a crucial role in ensuring that our people are well-informed, making them assets to our schools, communities, and nation. During the pandemic, with the shutdown of schools in Davao City, the Davao City Library launched the program “Share a Book” for people undergoing quarantine at the temporary treatment and monitoring facilities. The Davao City Library also continued the implementation of the Book Lending Program to give community children educational activities while the city was on lockdown. Through the Davao City’s Mobile Library — a bus loaded with books and other reading materials — books were delivered right to the barangays. And children were asked to choose which books they want to read. We know that the National Library of the Philippines has spearheaded outreach activities in public schools, organized storytelling activities and reading challenge sessions, puppet shows, and other activities that show your commitment to promoting intellectual freedom, access to right information, and infinite learning continues to enrich the minds of Filipinos. You have safeguarded our national treasures, guided the success of our students, educators, and researchers, and preserved intergenerational connectedness with a shared passion – providing equal opportunity for self-education or personal development for all. May this gathering deepen the importance of our libraries in connecting various communities and enabling inclusive social development. And may you continue to ensure that libraries are safe spaces for Filipinos, especially our children, to learn. Lastly, may I say that the magical world of knowledge hidden in every library can only be genuinely unlocked if one has mastered the Dewey Decimal System. And please, don’t forget your library cards. Shukran. Maraming salamat."
VPSD Speech for the Pastors’ Congress Jesus is Lord Church,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-pastors-congress-jesus-lord-church,2022-10-26,"VPSD Speech for the Pastors’ Congress Jesus is Lord Church, Novotel Manila | Araneta CityOctober 26, 2022 | 10:00 AM Assalamualaikum! Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. STANDARD GREETINGS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GUESTS… Taus-puso po akong nagpapasalamat sa inyong lahat, lalo na kay Brother Eddie Villanueva, sa kanyang imbitasyon. Isa pong karangalan ang makasama kayo sa inyong pagdiriwang ng 44th anniversary ng Jesus is Lord Church. Matanda lang po ako ng anim na buwan sa Jesus is Lord, Brother Eddie, na inyong tinatag 44 years ago. At alam ko na ang mga nakalipas na mga taon — na puno ng mga pagsubok, tagumpay at kung anu-anu pa mang mga karanasan natin sa buhay — ay mas nagpatatag pa sa inyong pagsasamahan, pagmamahalan sa isa’t isa, malasakit sa kapwa Pilipino at sa bansa, at pananampalataya sa Diyos. I come with words of admiration for the 44 years you have dedicated to spreading the word of God and winning spiritual battles for our nation. I am also here to tell you that your intercession and ministry to the families, fathers, women, professionals, youth, people from all walks of life, including those who are in jail --- are not in vain. The Church has become a real refuge for those who have grown emotionally tired and mentally embattled. Your commitment and sacrifice to reach out, spend time, and minister to these people have truly changed lives one prayer at a time. Personally, I find it comforting to know that the people of God are praying for the nation. In these trying times, I believe that all of us are called by God to help rebuild the nation – the land of promise that God has given us. I hope that as we pray for healing, for victory, for deliverance, we will also be blessed with the gift of unity as we journey together post-pandemic. The church is considered the soul of the nation. The Church is the conscience barometer that provides a moral compass and has guided Filipinos in their actions, decisions, and interactions in their daily lives. Sa panahon na tingin natin ay wala tayong kasama, wala tayong kakampi, walang nagmamahal sa atin — simbahan ang ating pinupuntahan upang magdasal. Sa ligaya at kalungkutan, nandyan lagi ang simbahan. Our overseas Filipino workers for example, regardless of whether they are in a Christian country or not, seek the Church and find ways to congregate to hear the word of God. When we celebrate milestones, when we struggle with life’s challenges and failures, we come to the Church for comfort and guidance. As an integral part of shaping the mind and conscience of the community, the church has a significant role in shaping our future, particularly in shaping the minds of our youth. Our youth are vulnerable and easily impressionable and I call upon the Church to help us guide our young Filipinos into the right path. The lures of substance abuse, violent extremism, and rebellion keep pulling away our country’s future. I believe this is where the Church can support nation-building. Your ministries to the communities have never been more relevant than now when our youth’s mental and psychological health are held hostage by various social media influences and peer and social pressure. Combined with the recent physical isolation because of Covid-19, they confuse the mind and push our youth to lose confidence in their ability to navigate life. Without professional help and spiritual guidance, some have been driven to self-harm and harm others. Apart from the youth, the Church bears weight in unifying the family as the basic unit of society. When parents leave town to work in big cities or abroad, it leaves a psychological harm that no amount of wealth or material things can fill. As you come together to reinforce your vision of nation-building, rest assured that we, at the government, are your partners in advocacies and ministries for the Filipino people. We share the same dream of creating a nation where families and people wisely manage their spiritual and civic affairs, all guided by a moral compass that is recognized by our Constitution and inherent in our lives as Filipinos. The call to build a strong nation is an open invitation. It is for us all. After all, we speak in universal truths of kindness, compassion, love, joy, and peace for all. May this be a common ground for all of us so that we can learn to arise, unite, regardless of faith differences, and build once again a stronger nation founded on the bedrock of Divine wisdom and faith. Patuloy nating mahalin ang Pilipinas! Maraming salamat po. Shukran."
"Speech of Vice President Sara Duterte for the 48th Philippine Business Conference and Expo Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industries Fiesta Pavilion, Manila Hotel",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-vice-president-sara-duterte-48th-philippine-business-conference-and-expo-philippine-chamber-commerce-and-industries-fiesta-pavilion-manila-hotel,2022-10-19,"Speech of Vice President Sara Duterte for the 48th Philippine Business Conference and Expo Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industries Fiesta Pavilion, Manila Hotel Assalamualaikum! Maayong adlaw kanatong tanan. Magandang araw sa ating lahat. Congratulations to the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industries — and may I express my admiration for your courage and commitment to the interest of the business sector and its contribution to the growth and development of the nation. The holding of this 48th Philippine Business Conference and Expo is a glowing proof of that courage and commitment. Efforts like this complement government’s efforts to bring about growth and development across the country — and benefit all sectors, especially the underprivileged and those lacking economic opportunities, access to livelihood, and employment. May I also point out the importance of the participation of everyone here, including our foreign visitors. It highlights our collective optimism for the greater things to come. As you may well know, in August this year, despite lingering fears and apprehensions by some sectors, the Department of Education took a bold step to open our schools once again to in-person learning. We welcomed over 28 million children and youth into our schools who have suffered learning loss as a result of the school closures during the pandemic. As we speak, our schools are aggressively implementing their learning recovery programs. It is not enough to just bring them back to school; we also need to accelerate learning by conducting remedial and enrichment classes to avoid long-term damage to our future workforce’s skills and productivity. As we transition to five days of face-to-face classes this November, we welcome the support of education stakeholders, parents, our local government units, civil society organizations, and private sector partners who have all contributed to strengthening our basic education system in the past years. These days, I am happy to share that the private sector has once again come to our aid. These are in the form of classroom building construction, teacher training, school grants, student competitions and awards including robotics and ICT talent competitions, nutrition education, school supplies distribution, reading materials, school preparedness advocacy, security, and mental health resources. Under the leadership of our president, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., we are committed to the goal for all Filipinos to realize their full potential and contribute meaningfully to a cohesive and productive nation. The government is aware of the poor performance of our schools in international education assessments. We are now in the process of completing our review of the K-12 program. The previous administration finished the review of the K to Grade 10 program. Under my administration, we are set to review Grades 11 and 12. Recently, DepEd issued an amendatory Department Order (DO) to DO 34, s. 2022 allowing private schools to offer blended learning modality and full distance learning options to their students. DepEd is cognizant of the current situation of private educational institutions due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic — the amount of investment in online learning technologies, the development and institutionalization of best practices on blended learning, and the unfortunate closure of small private schools because of losses. DepEd will leave the discussion on the learning modality to be implemented by private education institutions to the schools, the parents/guardians, and the learners. However, we hope that parents/guardians of private school learners would not miss the abundance of scientific studies available on the advantages of in-person classes over online learning. We have also just signed the First Time Jobseekers Assistance Act – Joint Operational Guidelines with the Department of Labor and Employment. The operational guidelines is a crucial step in the implementation of RA 11261, or the First Time Jobseekers Assistance Act. We expect more first-time jobseekers, especially our K-12 graduates, to be given the opportunity to process their pre-employment requirements immediately and cost-free. We are a nation comprised of young, able, and ambitious human resources. Each year, thousands of graduates join our workforce. Our goal is to facilitate job opportunities for them so they can start to earn and contribute to their families, build their dreams, and grow into valuable assets for nation-building. Our programs and plans for the next eight years are laid out in our Basic Education Development Plan 2030. This is the first long-term plan for basic education in the country. The BEDP 2030 is also a promise that we will continue to find ways to improve basic education in terms of access, equity, quality, resiliency, and governance. I invite you to come sit with us during our education stakeholders’ convergence next month to uncover opportunities for collaboration and public-private partnerships. We need transformational leadership from the business sector. There is a growing consumer consciousness to support businesses with a demonstrated commitment to sustainability and social impact. I hope this conference and expo will bring to the table multiple options for collaboration and new and renewed investment opportunities. With great optimism, we are ready for greater collaborations to achieve this administration’s economic and social development goals. Once again, congratulations on the success of this event. Patuloy nating mahalin ang Pilipinas. Shukran."
VPSD Speech for the 7th Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) Convention for Public Attorneys,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-7th-mandatory-continuing-legal-education-mcle-convention-public-attorneys,2022-10-13,"Event Date: October 13, 2022 | 3:30 – 4:00 PM at Philippine International Convention Center Assalamualaikum!Madayaw ug maayong hapon kaninyong tanan. Magandang hapon sa inyong lahat. I commend the Public Attorney’s Office and the organizing committee members for the successful conduct of the 7th Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Convention for our public attorneys. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone for their accomplishments in 2021. You surpassed your target cases handled, including appealed cases that were favorably disposed of and served 9.7 million Filipinos. That is not an easy feat considering that we were still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, public attorneys were instructed to give their official work cellphone numbers to their clients. Thus, ensuring that clients are able to reach their attorneys with minimal risk for both parties. PAO also authorized the conduct of home visits for clients with special needs and further expanded its reach through online legal counseling broadcasted live on social media. This is why our chief public attorney in the Philippines, Dr. Persida Rueda-Acosta, always stands tall and dignified in all her public appearances. One look at her, and you know she is proud to lead an organization providing accessible, efficient, high-quality, and effective legal services to indigents and other qualified persons. We continue to be plagued with social issues and injustices, and many Filipinos need legal representation. This is true, especially among Indigenous Peoples and the marginalized sector. With limited resources and scant opportunities, their hope for seeking justice depends largely on the dedication, commitment, and exercise of servant-leadership of our Public Attorney’s Office. Just recently, the news on the push for strengthening the enforcement of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act was highlighted when the Department of Social Welfare and Development partnered with your office for complaints against estranged fathers who fail to provide financial support to their children. Single and abandoned mothers are disadvantaged in carrying the burden of raising their children. The partnership of two government offices provides additional protection to solo parents and their children. In my accession to the office, we have started receiving requests from fellow Filipinos currently facing incarceration for free legal assistance and support for expeditious hearings of their cases. Recognizing the substantial role that our lawyers at the Public Attorney’s Office play, we have conducted initial talks with Chief Acosta for assistance in these requests. Thank you very much, ma’am for your support to the Office of the Vice President. We do not and cannot afford to cease learning as legal professionals and guardians of justice. It is a noble opportunity to take as we help ensure the integrity of the law and continue to uphold, despite challenges and disruptions, the inherent democratic rights enshrined in our Constitution and the laws of the land. I continue to hope for the best in our role of championing the rights of our marginalized and underrepresented citizens. Once again, congratulations and may the odds, indeed, be constantly in favor of justice and equality for all. Patuloy nating mahalin ang Pilipinas! Shukran."
VPSD Speech for Gawad Karangalan ng Lungsod ng Dasmariñas,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-gawad-karangalan-ng-lungsod-ng-dasmarinas,2022-09-23,"City of Dasmariñas Arena September 23, 2022 Assalamualaikum! Maraming salamat sa Lungsod ng Dasmariñas para sa pagkakataon na binigay ninyo para makasama ko kayo ngayong araw. Espesyal ang araw na ito para sa inyo kung kaya ikinararangal ko na bahagi ako ng inyong selebrasyon. Sa mga kikilalanin ngayong araw at bibigyan ng Gawad Karangalan ng lokal na pamahalaan ng Lungsod ng Dasmariñas — ang akin pong taus-pusong congratulations sa inyong lahat. You have achieved and brought honor not only for yourself and your family but also to your beloved city. But more than that, thousands of Filipino children and youth all over the country will be looking up to you with eyes full of admiration for what you have achieved academically. And they will also be looking at you with eyes of curiosity over what you possibly could do and will become in the coming years. You are here because of your sacrifice, persistence, diligence, and hard work in your academic pursuit. This is a recognition as much as it is a validation of the efforts you had to put in to be on top of your game. Today’s event is a seedbed where culture of excellence that inspires people to excel, achieve, and succeed is propagated and nurtured — to get that dream job or career, to build that dream house for your family, to have that dream life. Let me commend the leadership of Mayor Jennifer Austria-Barzaga for an initiative that advances the value of excellence in education — and for promoting the endless possibilities and opportunities awaiting those who are academically competent and successful. This is also an initiative that creates a community of people we would possibly later see at the frontlines — leading our country’s growth and development through their chosen professions and career paths. To the awardees, aminin natin — may mga maiinggit sa inyo. But you deserve to be here, you deserve to be recognized, and you deserve to celebrate because you worked hard for this. At marami rin ang titingala sa inyo. Marami ang susunod sa inyo. At marami ang mangangarap na sana ay kagaya sila ninyo. And that’s one of the best parts of being recognized as among the best in your community. One of the best parts, I would say, because the award will not only allow your academic competence and accomplishments to shine, but it will also bring to light your character as a person — how you would inspire others to follow your path, to chase their own dreams, and work really, really hard to get the life that they want for themselves. Because your award comes with a responsibility and a challenge — and this is to do more, to be more, and to serve other people, your communities, your city, and our country. Some of you are just about to start the journey. Some are still halfway through, while some have just reached the finish line of success. And yet there are also some of you who, despite having reached the finish line of success, are again embarking on another journey. They are restless. They are unstoppable. They are motivated by an ambition that must be fulfilled. To all of you, congratulations. And I wish that you become successful in the pursuit of your dreams. And maybe, some of you might take the road of public service and make that ultimate decision to give back — I wish to see your brilliance shining through our communities and our country. Shukran. Daghang salamat."
VPSD Speech for Gentrimed Heroes Movement Inc.,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-gentrimed-heroes-movement-inc,2022-09-23,"Assalamualaikum. Maraming salamat po sa lahat ng mga nasa likod ng pagtitipon na ito. Isa itong pambihirang pagkakataon kung saan magkakasama ang iba’t ibang sektor na may mahahalagang papel na ginagampanan sa ating pagsisikap at pagkilos na itayo ang isang matatag, masagana, at mapayapang bansa. The Marcos administration is aggressively pushing for the country’s sustainable growth — and we have recently seen the support of many of our neighboring countries for our government’s agenda. These expressions of support encourage us in the government to do more. As the Vice President of the Philippines, I personally feel more encouraged to do better when I see our fellow Filipinos supporting government programs and projects through their own sectoral or community initiatives that, regardless of their simplicity or proportions or magnitude, are scintillating with inspiration, with hope — encouraging Filipinos to stand for the nation and become Filipinos helping fellow Filipinos. I thank the Heroes Movement, Inc — and I am profoundly grateful —for an initiative that ticks all the boxes we need in our call for unity to advance our progress and development as a nation. Bayanihan. Volunteerism. Love of country. Love of fellow Filipinos. Dedication. Passion for change. These are not just words. These are people. Real people. They are Filipino people. From people-led initiatives, community-based movements, small businesses, youth-organized advocacies, church activities, university academic programs, NGO campaigns, medical professionals’ outreach, a private company’s programs to a mother’s intention to volunteer in a cause that are with aligned with the government agenda — all these will make a significant difference in our pursuit for peace, growth, and development in our country. You have started the call for national healing and provided the opportunity to become part of the bigger call for nation-building. And so, allow me to address the elephant in the room. Hate. I believe that hate has damaged us as a nation — divided us, and will further break us into pieces if we don’t let it go. And it’s the same hate that will stop us from being heroes. Daghang salamat to the Heroes Movement, Inc. for offering Filipinos this beautiful opportunity to participate in the cause to do good, to be good, to volunteer, to join the movement of healing and rebuild the nation, to become productive members of the community, and to become agents of truth, compassion, and change. I always say, “patuloy nating mahalin natin ang Pilipinas.” And here today, from you, I just heard loudest, the most powerful response to that call. Sa muli, patuloy nating mahalin ang Pilipinas. Shukran. Maraming salamat."
Speech Delivered by VP Sara Duterte in Siquijor for the 50th Founding Anniversary of the Island Town,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-delivered-vp-sara-duterte-siquijor-50th-founding-anniversary-island-town,2022-09-11,"September 11, 2022 Assalamualaikum. Malipayong pagsaulog sa inyong ika-singkwenta ka anibersaryo — Siquijor!!! Ang inyong kasadya nga naglanog-lanog karon sa tibuok isla usa ka pamatuod sa inyong panaghiusa isip katawhan nga gipadasig sa mga pangandoy ug mga damgo nga dungan ninyong gipanday alang sa inyong mga kaugalingon ug alang sa inyong minahal nga munisipalidad. Usa kini ka mahinungdanon nga adlaw. Og dako ang akong kalipay nga tungod sa inyong imbitasyon, nakaabot ako dinhi karon sa inyong matahom nga isla — ug nakigduyog sa inyong kasadya. Gapasalamat ko kay Mayor Richard Quezon sa imbitasyon ug sa paghiusa niining selebrasyon aron atong handumon ang mga paningkamot sa mga Siquijodnon sa pagpalambo sa inyong isla. Today marks a new beginning for Siquijor and its people, a beginning marked by a great sense of optimism for a future that is stable and strong, nurtured and fortified by the lessons of the past 50 years. At a glance, life in Siquijor appears slow and easy and has an endless connection to the natural beauty and the island's mystique that brings serenity to the soul and healing to a wounded heart. But the other face of the island bursts a different life that flows through the potentials of Siquijor. The daily arrivals and departures of ferries symbolize the openness of Siquijor and the Siquijodnons embrace of progress. Deep in the long history of the people and the island, your forebears instilled a sense of strong character and purpose of what it means to keep the image of Siquijor even as we all navigate through the demands of the modern time Through the Covid-19 pandemic and the devastations brought by Typhoon Odette, the people of Siquijor showed vigor and stood up to keep the culture, the traditions and faith of the people, the quiet and peace, and the magic of the island alive. As the economy reopens, it is also high time to string together these potentials and bring them to the frontier of the progress of the island that is pulsing with the dynamism of its people. Tourism remains one of your strengths. I hope tourism will create waves and waves of growth post-pandemic — benefiting everyone on the island. But let me emphasize this— everyone is your most valued strength. With everyone around each other, the possibilities are boundless. And the changes that we can make are enormous. With the local government unit’s efforts to provide the people excellent public service, I am confident that you will be able to scale up the local economy into a resplendent, premium investment destination in this part of the Visayas. The people of Siquijor should rally behind each other and support its government for the Island of Siquijor to reach its potentials and implement the plans and programs effectively and successfully. Both the local government and the people should trust each other and together create a better life on the island. To achieve this vision, we must create spaces and opportunities for our people — allowing them to become productive citizens and partners in building our nation. With this important task and the government's continued initiatives, no Siquijodnon will be left behind. And with this— no island, like Siquijor, will only beacon because of its charm that mystify the curiosity of the uninitiated or the imagination of the curious. Our leaders and government partners are taking full responsibility that the developmental trajectory we have embarked on in the new administration will be witnessed, participated in, experienced, and relished by Siquijodnons, and make sure that we are effectively investing in their aspirations, skills, and economic activities. We are counting on the devoted hands of Siquijodnons. It's a gift that protects the integrity of the island, and the identity of its people. You are all participants in the developmental endeavors your leaders have set for your beloved home. Truly united, we can collectively reach the progress destined for Siqujor — as abundant and blessed as the dreams of Siquijodnons. Again, happy 50th. Padayon pag-uswag, Siquijor. Shukran. Daghang salamat."
VPSD Message for Province of Cotabato 108th Founding Anniversary (Kalivungan 2022),https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-message-province-cotabato-108th-founding-anniversary-kalivungan-2022,2022-09-01,"Theme: Matatag na Cotabato, Susulong sa Anumang HamonSeptember 1, 2022 Assalamualaikum. Magandang araw sa lahat. Maayong adlaw ug malipayong pagsaulog sa Kalivungan Festival, North Cotabato. Una ang akong pagpasalamat sa inyohang tanan sa imbitasyon ninyo sa akoa na motanbong sa inyohang Kalivungan Festival. Ikaduha ko na ni na pagtambong sa inyohang Kalivungan Festival ug nalipay ko ug dako na nakadawat ko og imbitasyon. Tungod sa inyohang imbitasyon, natagaan ko ug oportunidad na mobisita usab dinhi sa inyoha ug makasuroy usab diri sa Mindanao. Natagaan pud ko og oportunidad na personal na magpasalamat sa inyohang tanan kauban si Pangulong Bongbong Marcos. Bisan paman, ug wala ko nakaanhi para mangampanya sa miagi na piniliay, inyong gihatag ang inyohang tibuok na suporta, pagsalig, og boto sa akoa ug sa akoang runningmate na si President Bongbong Marcos Jr. Ang amoang pamilya, ang pamilya Duterte, nagapasalamat pud sa inyohang tanan sa unom katuig na gihatag ninyo ang inyong suporta sa administrasyon ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte. Dako ang akong kalipay sa inyong imbitasyon kanako nga mahimong ka-parte sa inyong kasaulugan sa 108th Founding Anniversary sa inyong probinsya. Nakita nato ang inyohang partisipasyon ug suporta sa inyohang Founding Anniversary karon — nagpakita sa inyohang interes na magtinabangay para makabangon ang atoang probinsya gikan sa kalamidad sa linog ug sa Covid-19 na pandemya. Daghang salamat sa atoang Governor Emmylou Taliño Mendoza ug sa tanang mga namuno sa Probinsya sa North Cotabato. The Office of the Vice President will extrude only the best kind of programs and projects that shall benefit the Filipino people. Ang Office sa Bise Presidente maningkamot nga mahimong matinud-anon sa katawhang Pilipino pinaagi sa pagpa-abot og maayong sebisyo sa katawhan. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused economic disruptions and resulted in losses — affecting employment, livelihood, and the education of our children. Today, you have shown that you are driving the road to recovery. And this should not be a lonely road. This should be a collective journey — our journey together — that even when we face challenges and threats, we do not cower, we do not stop and surrender to fear, to disappointments, to energies and forces that injure or break our spirit as a nation. Instead, we go on braver, bolder, and stronger. And we are braver, bolder, and stronger because we have each other. Mao kana ang ginapakita karon sa Kalivungan Festival. Mao kana ang ginapakita karon sa katawhan sa North Cotabato. Ug mao kana ang gipakuta ninyo na suporta sa bago lang nahuman na Kadayawan Festival didto sa Davao. Unity. At the heart of the Kalivungan Festival is the unity among the people of North Cotabato, who have been emboldened by the unwavering strength that deeply binds them together — nevermind the race, nevermind the religion and beliefs, nevermind the social status. This is a celebration of the countless times that the Province of North Cotabato rejected adversity, divisiveness, and the many brutal armed conflicts that caused many lives — and instead, North Cotabato forged friendships, alliances, and unities and addressed the causes of conflicts down to the grassroots. This is a celebration of the development and the peace now pervading across the province. I am confident that you will remain resolute and courageous in taking on and overcoming even the most difficult of challenges and even the darkest of times that may come your way in the future. We should sustain the gains of the friendships and unities we have forged despite our diversity and ensure that the next generation of Cotabateños will be able to experience the abundance of our resources, our culture, and the harmonious and peaceful life we have today. Akoa lang isingit dinhi sa akoang speech karon ang pagpahinumdom kaninyong tanan na sa inyong tanansa atoang pagkahiusa, kinahanglan isa lang ang atoang direksyon as a province and as a country. Ug dili nato hatagan og suporta ang mga tawo na gusto gubaon ang atong kalinaw na natangamtam na dinhi sa atong probinsya ug sa atong naog. Let us not support terrorists. Let us not support the New People’s Army. I congratulate Gov Lala Mendoza and all the officials of the province and the entire people of North Cotabato for the success of the Kalivungan Festival. May you pursue further prosperity and ensure that the Cotabato province will shine brighter as a beautiful destination in Mindanao and our country. While we continue to live in an extraordinary time, we should remind ourselves of how courageously we have tackled the pandemic. And now, we are on the road to recovery. We are together on this road to recovery. And please allow me to reiterate this — today, more than ever, we should not allow anyone or anything to break us. Kalivungan Festival is a beautiful opportunity for us to renew and strengthen the unity that has brought us all where we are today. Kaganina nangutana ko sa atoang Governador kung ang inyoha bang mga presentation ay competition pareho sa atong bago lang nahuman na Kadayawan Festival. Pero ingo si Gov, kini gibuhat lang jud sa tanan dili tungod sa kompetisyon, kundi sa ilang pagmahal sa ilang probinsya. Ang tinuod ato, nangutana ko kay Gov kay mudungag unta ko sa premyo. Unya kay dili man diay contest, wala koy ikadungag na premyo kay wala man diay ni premyo. Sa ato pa, manghatag nalang ug pahalipay sa tanan. Tanan nga mga grupo na nagpakita sa ilahang pagkahiusa sa ilahang probinsya ug sa selebrasyon ninyo sa Kalivungan Festival. Dahil mahal ninyo ang probinsya ng Cotabato, dahil mahal ko kayo, ang atoang mga grupo, 11 kabuok, tagaan nato ug tag-30 thousand each group. Unta gamiton ninyo sa pagpalambo sa inyong grupo sa music and the arts. Usabon nako, nalipay kong dako na nakabisita ko usab dinhi sa inyoha sa probinsya sa Cotabato. Daghang salamat, ug maayong buntag sa inyong tanan."
VPSD Speech for the 55th Founding Anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-55th-founding-anniversary-association-southeast-asian-nations-asean,2022-08-08,"Monday, August 8, 2022 Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen — maayong buntag sa inyong tanan, magandang umaga sa lahat, good morning to everyone. Assalamualaikum. Today, we celebrate the 55th Founding Anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN. This is a celebration of enduring friendship, cooperation, and unity made stronger in the past 55 years as nations in a region with common pre-colonial history — and today — nations with served, shared dreams and aspirations. The 10-member ASEAN may be different in more ways than one — from language to faith and beliefs, culture and tradition, food, and maybe politics — but we treated these differences as uniqueness, and these uniqueness allowed us to nurture our respect for and deepen our understanding of each other, foster cooperation in a wide range of areas, and strengthen economic relations and partnerships. The theme ASEAN: Addressing Challenges Together or ASEAN: ACT, set by current ASEAN chair, Cambodia, under the leadership of His Excellency Prime Minister Hun Sen, underscores the spirit of togetherness and unity as one community. Togetherness and unity — these have been the underlying values that formed the foundation from which ASEAN was built 55 years ago today, and these are some of the values that continue to reverberate — and even more meaningfully and resoundingly — now that the world is facing the challenges brought about by the Covid 19 pandemic and complex regional and international security challenges and their repercussions to our economic stability. Let me emphasize that the Philippines is now aggressively pursuing a future alongside a youth sector aware and conscious of its essential role in nation-building. Important role — as this is something that should not be dismissed or something that should be lost in the noise brought by the complexity of our current time. Filipino youth should realize that standing for their country’s interest is ingrained in their being Filipinos. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that for ASEAN to be able to successfully pursue its regional agenda, the ASEAN to be able to maintain its strong presence in the world, we should seriously invest in our youth. As we endeavor to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, our challenge is to figure out how to ensure that all of ASEAN will reach its potential by 2030. Your excellencies, I believe that we should focus on the ASEAN youth. Today, ASEAN is home to more than 600 million people. We have a larger population than the European Union or North America. We make up the third-largest labor force in the world, just behind China and India. And the majority of our population is composed of young people. Education. We all know that if we are successful in providing our children with access to quality education, coupled with a deep sense of love of country and fellowmen, our future is secured. One of the ways to involve the ASEAN youth is to ensure that they are equipped with the knowledge and skill set needed in a highly competitive environment. By strengthening intraregional scholarships and cultural exchanges between our countries, we will be able to increase the free flow of ideas, innovations, and skills. Each of our countries has unique strengths. But our diversity is our strength. To help each other, we must develop our human capital and workforce by jointly developing the skills that our youth may capitalize on in the future. ASEAN languages may be offered in our schools and universities. While the Philippines has been sending English-language teachers to our Southeast Asian neighbors for years, I believe it is high time we encourage our youth to learn each other’s national languages. With a collaborative and nurturing environment within our region, we allow our youth to grow and mature as ASEAN citizens while forging meaningful friendships and relationships with their ASEAN neighbors. Governments play a central role in shaping the future of our youth, and with intraregional scholarships and cultural exchanges, we will be able to shape the future of ASEAN. The young people of ASEAN deserve a future characterized by stability, prosperity, increased mobility, and competitiveness. As we celebrate this milestone, may we strengthen the ASEAN regional cooperation even more through unity in diversity — guided by the vision and will to allow the youth to be the forefront of our undertakings as individual countries and as a regional bloc. We still have time. We have the resources. Now more than ever, together, we must act as one. Mabuhay ang ASEAN.Daghang salamat. Maraming salamat. Thank you."
Speech for the Launching of OVP Buses,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/speech-launching-ovp-buses,2022-08-03,"Wednesday, August 3, 2022 at PITX Maayong buntag sa inyong tanan. Assalamualaikum. It is a pleasure to be here today at the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange, bringing something we could consider good news. Today, we will officially launch the Office of the Vice President’s ‘Peak Hours Augmentation Bus Service - Libreng Sakay’ Program. We hope that through this program, we will be able to provide relief to some of our fellow Filipinos who rely on public transport for their daily commute to work, to school, and to many other places. We launch this program today simultaneously with other key areas in Mindanao and the Visayas. Two buses will be deployed in Metro Manila, one in Davao City, one in Cebu, and another one in Bacolod. Let me emphasize that this program is a demonstration of effective government and private sector collaboration. These buses were lent to us for OVP use. But as I said, the team decided that it would be more useful if they were deployed in some key areas of the country to support the libreng sakay of the DOTR. It will support the national government’s program, and at the same time, it is hoped that this meager contribution will translate to daily savings for our public transport-riding kababayans. I am hoping that this is just the start of many more fruitful collaborations with the private sector that are willing to spare their resources to provide much-needed relief to the public, especially now that the country continues to reel and recover from the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic and grappling from the effects of the global economic crisis. Sa muli, napatunayan na naman natin na walang problemang hindi kayang solusyunan, kung tayo ay nagkakaisa at naniniwala na sa tulong ng ating gobyerno at mga kaibigan at supporters sa pribadong sektor, malalampasan natin ang lahat ng hamon na ating kinakaharap. Maraming salamat sa inyong walang sawang suporta sa akin at sa buong administrayon ni Pangulong Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Patuloy po nating mahalin ang Pilipinas. Shukran. Daghan salamat. Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat."
"VPSD Speech for Brigada Eskwela Kick-Off in Imus, Cavite",https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vpsd-speech-brigada-eskwela-kick-imus-cavite,2022-08-01,"Monday, August 1, 2022 Ladies and gentlemen, Assalamulaikum. Madayaw ug maayong buntag kaninyong tanan. Magandang umaga sa inyong lahat. Let me first acknowledge the men and women of the Department of Education behind this significant event today — an event that, we must admit, is causing both excitement and a little bit of uneasiness or anxiety to some of our teachers, some parents, and maybe to some of our learners. Excitement — because Brigada Eskwela activities all over the country always highlight the communal efforts of all education stakeholders to prepare our schools for our learners. We would see parents who are excited, willing, and happy to extend any help they could to ensure that our schools are ready to receive our learners from Day 1 of the opening of classes and onwards to the school year. The collaboration between the parents, the teachers, local governments, and the entire community on Brigada Eskwela opens deeper and meaningful collaborations even until after the school year closes. Uneasiness or anxiety — because of the peculiarity of our time now. We continue to face the threats of the Covid 19 pandemic, along with many other unexpected challenges that hamper our daily progress for our learners — monkeypox, baha, bagyo, earthquake — all of that will come. What is important is that we have the determination to succeed in our mission. We are all set to open our schools all over the country 22 days from now. To address the valid concerns over Covid 19 transmission, we have laid down measures that will serve as our guide to prevent our children from contracting the virus as I continually call on our teaching and non-teaching unvaccinated Department of Education personnel to go to counseling and consider, reconsider your decision about vaccination. Meanwhile, only last week, the province of Abra and other areas of Northern Luzon were jolted by a powerful earthquake that affected more than 9,000 schools. The assessment conducted by the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Service showed that the government would need P1.4 Billion for the repair of 451 classrooms destroyed by the earthquake and the other 706 classrooms that sustained damage. Two weeks ago, I also visited Clarin National School of Fisheries in Bohol and saw the traces of the destruction of Typhoon Odette that ravaged the island. But Typhoon Odette also destroyed many schools not only in the Visayas but also in Mindanao. We all know these problems and the other problems and challenges that the Department of Education and its partners are facing year in and year out. As mentioned by Asec. Bringas, we were in a meeting last week and I was telling our Usecs and Asecs that we are in a quicksand. Hindi pa nga natin naayos at natapos ang destruction ng isang kalamidad, dumating na naman ang isang kalamidad. And we need more than P18 Billion, excluding the P1.4 Billion of damages from the Abra earthquake to get ourselves out of the quicksand of this year and last year. It does not include the things, or the repairs that we have to do from 2016. But I am confident and I am optimistic that Department of Education will overcome — and we will overcome with the support of our national government and the administration of President Bongbong Marcos. What DepEd Calabarzon did is an example of how we will be determined and resilient in the face of adversity. As mentioned earlier, there was really no notice about our program this morning here in Imus. But we are here, we were able to do our program. And the difference between possible and impossible is our determination to overcome all challenges to succeed. The past administration has left us with a roadmap to look into and guide our steps to ensure that our target to deliver basic education to our learners becomes a success. With the national government supporting DepEd, with the Basic Education Development Plan 2030 serving as our guide — the success of the Department’s plans and programs shall now be completed by our undying love for the profession of teaching Filipino children, our children, the future of our nation. That we are gathering here today to pilot Brigada Eskwela all over the country — with your presence here — it is truly inspiring, and I hope that the energy that you are showing today will create waves and waves of the same energy and will reach even the farthest public school in the Philippines. And even if you don’t feel that energy, you get up every morning and psych yourself to feel, and to do everything with passion and energy, and enthusiasm to achieve. Ngayon pa lang ay nagpapasalamat na ako sa inyo at sa libo-libong mga kawani ng DepEd sa buong bansa, sa mga magulang ng ating mga mag-aaral, at mga partner organizations and local governments. We thank here today the provincial government of the province of Cavite represented by Vice Governor Tolentino, and the city of Imus represented by Mayor Advincula. Maraming salamat po sa patanggap ninyo sa amin dito sa probinsya ng Cavite. Dahil sa inyong pagsusumikap, suporta, at pagmamahal sa bayan, kaya magiging matagumpay ang pagbubukas natin ng bagong school year at pagpapatupad natin ng mga proyekto at programa sa DepEd, isa na diyan ang in-person learning para sa ating mga anak. Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat na bumubuo ng Imus Pilot Elementary School at sa ating DepEd Schools Division Office, sa pamumuno ni Dra. Rosemarie Torres, sa ating mga bisita na SDS at ASDS, at Usecs and Asecs.

VP Keynote Speech for 168th Founding Anniversary Province of Bohol,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vp-keynote-speech-168th-founding-anniversary-province-bohol,2022-07-22,"July 22, 2002 Theme: Hhiniusang Paglantaw: Abante sa bag-ong ugma Assalamualaikum. To our elected officials, sa minamahal kong mga Boholano, guests, magandang araw po sa ating lahat, maajong adlaw sa tanan. Today is a triumph for the province of Bohol. I am honored to be with you on the celebration your 168-year heritage of your province. Let us acknowledge the hard work of your leaders and the contributions of the people of Bohol as we celebrate this occasion. Boholanos ang fiercely protective of their peace and unity. And it was shown in one incident nga dunay mga terrorista who sought refuge in your island. And paspas kaayo naresolba ang problema tungod kay ang mga Boholano was very cooperative with our law enforcement officers sa pagtudlo kung kinsa ang mga tao na terrorista ug mga dunay dautan nga mutibo na misulod sa inyohang isla. I really have to agree that Boholanos are fiercely protective of their place, of their territory. And of course, your culture and unity as people. Let us also honor and reflect on Bohol’s deep history– of indigenous culture, colonization, and liberation, including the recent memories still throbbing in the heartfelt stories of our families who have been battled by calamities but chose to rise above and reclaim their lives. Nalipay pud ko sa ikaduha nga nakadawat ko ug imbitasyon gikan sa inyoha na mutambong sa inyong selebrasyon sa Bohol day tungod kay nahatagan ko ug oportunidad pud na mubisita didto sa clarin para makighimamat sa atoang mga maestra, sa atoang mga regional directors sa Department of Education, ug sa atong schools division superintendent para maistoryahan ang mga kinahanglan pa na buhaton nga mga repairs and reconstruction and renovation sa atoang mga buildings nga nadaot sa nilabay na kalamidad na Odette. Bohol is dear to my heart. I was with you when you surmounted the devastation of Typhoon Odette. Those were difficult, sleepless days and nights for all of you. Yet, I witnessed how you ascended to acceptance, forgiveness, and starting anew. Out of this shared experience comes your collective courage to rebuild the province back into its iconic beauty. For everyone to see its charm again – the works of miracles arranged by the devoted and loving hands of the Boholanos. To see all of you today, the same people, now armored with tenacity and grace, is a glorious moment and I am happy to be with you, to be with all of you today. The province of Bohol has always been a welcoming place, a new home for others, and one of the finest spots in the global view, glistening in its continued preservation of people, culture, tradition and faith. This is a gathering to put another seed of optimism in the hands of the Boholanos. This new life pulses alongside the potentials inherent to this province. Ang pag-abante sa maayong ugma pinaagi sa hiniusang paglantaw usa ka halangdon nga gasa sa atong mga kamot. Dili tanan lugar dunay gasa nga sama niini. Dinhi sa Bohol, nagkahiusa gayud kamo sa inyong tinguha nga maka tagamtam ang tanan og maayong pagpuyo — bisan pa man sa kadaghan nga miagi nga kalisud. Pinaagi sa inyong pagkahiusa, walay duha-duha nga maabot gayud ang adlaw, nga makita ninyo ang bunga sa inyong paningkamut. (Advancing a better tomorrow through a united vision is a noble gift in our hands. Not every place has a gift like this. Here in Bohol, you are truly united in your desire for everyone to enjoy a good life — despite the many past hardships. Through your unity, there is no doubt that the day will come, when you will see the fruit of your efforts.) The entire Bohol will blossom, blossom again, blossom more — and you’ll be there again, in awe of what power your collective courage and harmony can bring. This harmony binds you together. It is the same harmony that is your guiding light — helping you reach many destinations. This is a direction to strengthen our families, where our children are secure and we are living in peace. This is a direction where our communities are moving forward, getting a taste of progress and development. But most importantly, this is the same direction where the readiness to extend generous support to our communities never dries up and never unnoticed and unreturned. May you continue to believe in yourselves so that together, you will accomplish your goals and join the rest of our people, fulfilling the mandate of God and our nation. Let us keep one another in friendship, prayer, and pride as we take the next steps of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. I ask the Boholanos’ support as the new administration makes decisions in our best interests. I hope that Bohol’s collective harmony and your faith that overcomes challenges will spread across the country and our ofws around the world. My dream is to see all of us, wearing a singular Filipino spirit for love of country and service just as the Boholanos. Patuloy po nating suportahan ang ating gobyerno at maging mas masigasig sana tayo sa pagpapakita ng ating pagmamahal sa ating bansa at kapwa filipino. Again, I am truly happy that I have received your invitation. Happy 168th Bohol day! Mabuhay kayong lahat."
VP Response To Private Educational Associations And Closing Remarks Virtual Meeting,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/vp-response-private-educational-associations-and-closing-remarks-virtual-meeting,2022-07-04,"July 4, 11-12am Via Zoom Assalamualaikum. Maayong udto. Magandang umaga po sa ating lahat. Let me thank former Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones and former Undersecretary Tonisito Umali for legislative affairs, external partnerships, project management service, and private education office for making this virtual meeting possible and for taking the time to bridge the relationship between my office and the private educational associations of the Philippines. I have heard the messages from three of our representatives of the National Private Education Associations. I have taken notes. And would like to assure you that we will take these issues into consideration — with the hope of coming up with appropriate actions and effective solutions. We are still reeling from the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, and while the Department of Education continues to provide basic education to our children in the public school sector, the effect of the pandemic on low-cost private schools was unprecedented. I understand that many private schools across the country are suffering from losses. Some private schools are facing closure. And a number have in fact already shut down. As a community, there is an urgent need to build back and build back stronger and better. The migration of students from private to public schools has put enormous strain on our public schools. Now that we are finally ready to open the doors to face-to-face classes, we need the help of our private schools in bringing our children and youth back to school. While we have existing measures under the enhanced basic education act, or republic act 10533, these measures were created before the pandemic. I ask for your indulgence as I also expect your support as we study and explore the appropriate measures to resolve issues and concerns that may adversely impact the education sector. Our task here is to protect our children and ensure that quality education is made accessible for them — whether they are enrolled in private or public schools, whether they are in the cities or the countryside. We look forward to forging a productive partnership with you. Daghang salamat. Mabuhay kayong lahat."
Pasasalamat at Pagpupugay,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/pasasalamat-pagpupugay,2022-07-04,"Bulwagan ng Karunungan, Kagawaran ng Edukasyon, Pasig City July 4, 2022 Assalamulaikum. Magandang hapon po sa ating lahat. Maayong hapon sa tanan. Today, we will honor the men and women of the department of education who stood firm and demonstrated great tenacity and courage to ensure that deped will be able to fulfill its mandate to the filipino children at all times — even at the height of the onslaught of the covid 19 pandemic. Headed by Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones, DepEd adapted and implemented bold but necessary measures to provide filipino children accessible and quality education — ensuring that learning is unhampered and our learners are not left out — while also ensuring the economic welfare of our teachers and the non-teaching personnel working under the organization. Secretary Liling is a force. And I am humbled and honored to follow in the footsteps of a much-admired academic, public servant, social activist, and change-maker. I would also like to acknowledge the equally devoted men and women, our undersecretaries and assistant secretaries who supported Ma’am Liling in the last six years. Daghang salamat kaninyo. When we talk about governance and public service, we talk about dedication, commitment, integrity, and selflessness. Pinakyaw na yata ito lahat ni Secretary Liling. At nagpapasalamat kami na hindi niya ito ipinagdamot sa ating lahat. Sa kanyang pangunguna, ipinakita ni Secretary Liling kung paano natin mabibigyan ng mas makabuluhan na tulong ang sektor ng edukasyon sa pamamagitan ng pagtuon sa mga isyu at mga problema ng mga kabataan at pagbibigay ng solusyon sa mga ito. Ma’am Liling, you have completed your mission, and we are all here today to celebrate the victories that you and the entire Department of Education have collected over the past six years under the Duterte administration. We were all witnesses as DepEd pushed the full implementation of the senior high school program that eventually allowed parents and students to see its significance in providing our graduates with the necessary skills relevant to today’s dynamic workforce. Thanks to Secretary Liling, thanks to this team — our public school teachers now earn more than their counterparts in the private sector. Indeed, you have broken a glass ceiling in Philippine education history. With the challenges emanating from the COVID 19 pandemic, Secretary Liling’s light shone the brightest as a leader, an educator, and a Filipina who has a deep concern for the education sector and love of country. Secretary Liling and the whole DepEd organization never cowered in the face of disapproval, public frustration, and pressure. When some sectors called for an academic freeze, the response was academic ease. and it was a brilliant, appropriate, and timely response — made with will and resolve, and foresight — that our children’s learning is shielded from the adverse impact of the pandemic. When you said, “education must continue. Education must never stop” — it was a statement that defined the direction of DepEd under your watch. You soldiered on for the sake of the Filipino children. The entire DepEd followed suit. And as I take on the task of being the next Secretary of the Department of Education, I take inspiration from you — from your courage, dedication, your commitment, your integrity, selflessness, and your grace. But I will also take on the task with the reminder that we shall continue to find ways to improve basic education in terms of access, equity, quality, resiliency, and governance — to produce learners who can achieve their full potential as individuals who are responsible, skilled, knowledgeable, productive, and determined to achieve their dreams for themselves and for our country. We look forward to working with you as we take on the task of helping our children become our country’s assets. Maraming salamat. Mabuhay po tayong lahat. Ako po si Inday Sara. Mahal natin ang Pilipinas."
Inaugural Speech of Vice President-Elect Sara Duterte,https://www.ovp.gov.ph/post/inaugural-speech-vice-president-elect-sara-duterte,2022-06-19,"June 19, 2022 Davao City Assalamualaikum. To our foreign guests, sa aking mga kababayan — magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat, maayong hapon kaninyong tanan. One of the most important lessons I have learned as I navigate life and the same thing that I believe we should ponder upon as one country united in our determination to overcome our difficulties and achieve our aspirations — is that we should commit to heart the priorities of God, country, and family. My life is a testament to the power of a God, whom we know by many names. My younger self was consumed by a dream to become a doctor. I pursued a pathway that I thought could help me realize that dream, but I was directed toward another way. And now I am a lawyer. When I committed myself to governance and public service, I was also determined to finish three consecutive terms as Mayor. That will not happen anymore. I am now the Vice President-Elect. The voice of 32.2 million Filipinos was loud and clear — with the message to serve our motherland. And this message has been reiterated in my oath: to consecrate myself to the service of the nation. There is a God. A God whose will transcends the desires of our hearts, one whose will directs us to the way that we might not have imagined — but a way that consecrates ourselves every day to help our fellowmen overcome the difficulties they face in their lives, to change lives, to save lives. If we all take a moment to listen to the call to serve and decide to heed the call — in the same way that many are already devoting their lives as hardworking farmers and fisherfolk that ensure there is food on our tables, dedicated health workers who help the sick, brave soldiers who fight for our country, honest and fair entrepreneurs who support our economy, patient school teachers that guide our children — I believe the country will be heading toward a future of hope, security, strength, stability, and progress. Country Today, we celebrate the life and works of our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. May his memory light up the fire within us to become patriots. Rizal taught us that selflessness and sacrifice could change our country's fate and shape our children's future. The bravery of Rizal completes the fabric of our identity as Filipinos. Magkasama sana tayong bumangon bawat araw kasabay ang nag-aalab na pangako sa ating mga puso na mahal natin at patuloy nating mamahalin ang Pilipinas hangga’t tayo ay nabubuhay. Let us show our love for our country by taking care of our families and communities despite the unending challenges that come our way. Family Today is Father’s Day. This is a time for families to celebrate — but you are here with me. Daghang salamat sa inyong pagtambong ug pagkuyog kanako niining adlawa. Happy Father’s day to all the fathers who make sure that another person is given the best of everything. Today, our children are facing a very complex future, one that is rife with conflict and uncertainties. Some of these challenges include the winding cycle of poverty, the trauma of broken families, the life-long baggage because of irresponsible and bad parenting, the abandonment issues due to an absentee parent, the anguish of gender confusion and discrimination, the destruction brought about by drugs, the lure of easy money in criminality, cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, the failure to identify and speak up against different kinds of abuses, the life altering effects of teenage pregnancy, the detrimental effects of illiteracy, the emotional injury of bullying, unstable mental wellness, recruitment to support terrorism, misinformation in the internet — and the list could be endless. A strong, loving, happy family sets down all the basic foundations essential in the development and growth of a child. At home, parents have the duty to teach children the values of integrity, discipline, respect, and compassion for others. And we should never forget that it is the duty of each Filipino family to emphasize that education begins at home. Atong isilsil sa ilang alimpatakan nga ang maayong pamatasan, ang edukasyon, ug pagpaningkamot maoy magdala kanila palayo sa kinabuhi nga puno og kalisod, padulong sa maayong kinabuhi nga ilang gihandom. We should not as we could not afford to squander the future of our children. The days ahead of us may be full of challenges that call for us to be more united as a nation. But let me reiterate this — we can never go wrong if we are a people dedicated to honoring the will of God, to serving our country and our fellowmen, and protecting the integrity of our families and the future of our children. Ako po si Inday Sara. A proud Dabawenya. A proud Mindanawon. Hindi ako ang pinakamagaling, o pinakamatalinong tao sa Pilipinas at sa mundo — ngunit walang makakatalo sa tibay ng puso ko bilang isang Filipino. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! Daghang Salamat."
